Access to YouTube was also blocked in 2007, and 2008 during high-profile government meetings and following last year's unrest in Tibet. YouTube has been blocked at least twice in the last month, according to Herdict Web, a censorship tracking system run by Harvard University's Berkman Center for Internet and Society.

Sonnenfeld, a professor at the Yale School of Management, who believes Mr. Lewis should resign. \"Even if everything he did was appropriate, it has hampered his legitimacy to lead.\" It was not long ago that Mr. Lewis was celebrated for his vision. His daring takeover of Merrill Lynch was the latest in a series of high-profile acquisitions that helped transform Bank of America into a national powerhouse. His conquests included the Countrywide Financial Group, the giant mortgage lender which, for many, came to symbolize the excesses of the subprime era. In December, the American Banker, the daily chronicle of the banking industry, named him 2008 Banker of the Year.", "hypothesis": "Ken Lewis studied at the Yale School of Management.", "idx": 2417}

{"premise": "Ian Tomlinson, 47, died last Wednesday after encountering riot police near the Bank of England as he returned home from his work as a newsagent. The footage, released yesterday by The Guardian, reveals a docile-looking Mr Tomlinson walking with his back to police officers at about 7.20pm. One Metropolitan Police officer appears to lunge at him with a baton from behind and he falls to the ground. A bystander had to help him to his feet.

{"premise": "The Grapes of Wrath, published exactly 70 years ago, can be seen as a prophetic novel, rooted in the tragedies of the Great Depression, but speaking directly to the harsh realities of 2009, writes Steinbeck scholar Robert DeMott. Steinbeck's epic novel, which traces harrowing exodus of Tom Joad and his family from blighted Oklahoma (where they are evicted from their farm), across the rugged American south-west via Highway 66, and on to what they mistakenly hope will be a more promising future in California, is considered by many readers to be the quintessential Depression-era story, and an ironic reversal of the rags-to-riches tale favoured by many optimistic Americans.", "hypothesis": "The Grapes of Wrath was written by Steinbeck.", "idx": 2421}
{"premise": "When a mosquito drinks the blood an infected person, the insect also swallows the malaria parasite, which then must incubate and multiply before migrating into the insect's saliva. The process can take weeks. And because mosquitoes are small-bodied and cold-blooded, outside temperatures make a big difference in how long it takes before they can transmit the disease. If it happens too slowly, the insects die before they can infect anyone. In general, the malaria parasite does better at warmer temperatures, which is why the disease occurs most often in tropical environments. But with mathematical models, Thomas has found that, even when conditions are warm, highly fluctuating temperatures over the course of a day slow down the rate of parasite incubation and larval development in the mosquito.", "hypothesis": "Warm weather facilitates the spreading of malaria.", "idx": 2422}

Gene Robinson is by his own description \"just the bishop.\" As the head of an Episcopal diocese of 16,000, he spends his days counseling priests and their families, visiting parishes, performing baptisms, attending confirmations and coordinating such projects as overseas missions and a campaign against the death penalty. What he does is important, he says, but not \"anything particularly special.\" But when he leaves the diocese, Robinson becomes what he calls \"this bigger-than-life thing.\" His mere appearance inspires misty eyes and standing ovations from some. To others, he is a pariah whose very identity makes him too tainted to share a pew or theological discussion. One person looks at him and sees the future of the church; another, its demise.", "hypothesis": "Nearly six years ago, Robinson became the first openly gay Episcopal bishop.", "idx": 2423}

El Gharani was arrested in Pakistan in 2001 at a mosque by local police and turned over to U.S. forces in 2002. He was one of the first Guantanamo Bay detainees and one of the youngest.

An area of thick jungle and mountains, roughly the size of Spain, Papua is the eastern-most outpost of the Indonesian archipelago, some 3,200km (2,000 miles) from the government in Jakarta. Culturally it feels even further. Papua became part of Indonesia in 1969 after a controversial and very limited vote.

{"premise": "When it comes to the recession, tactful New Yorkers may refrain from complaining too loudly about their misfortunes, knowing that the chances are, there is someone else out there who has it worse. But try explaining to a 6-year-old, no matter how worldly and well mannered, that budget cuts may prevent him from spending quality time with a penguin.

Czech psychiatrists supervising the treatment - a one-hour operation that involves removal of the tissue that produces testosterone - insist that it is the most foolproof way to tame sexual urges in dangerous predators suffering from extreme sexual disorders. Surgical castration has been a means of social control for centuries. In ancient China, eunuchs were trusted to serve the imperial family inside the palace grounds; in Italy several centuries ago, youthful male choir members were castrated to preserve their high singing voices.", "hypothesis": "In China sex offenders have to be treated with surgical castration.", "idx": 2431}

On Tuesday morning, when the Louvre reopened to the public, she was gone. Within hours of the discovery of the empty frame, stashed behind a radiator, the story broke in an extra edition of Le Temps, the leading morning newspaper.

{"premise": "The Pope courted further controversy on his first trip to Africa today by declaring that condoms were not a solution to the Aids epidemic - but were instead part of the problem. In his first public comments on condom use, the pontiff told reporters en route to Cameroon that Aids \"is a tragedy that cannot be overcome by money alone, and that cannot be overcome through the distribution of condoms, which even aggravates the problems\".

Groppi Cafe downtown, where he ordered the chocolate cakes he sent to friends and bought the bonbons he gave to their children, who called him Uncle Tarek. Friends and acquaintances here in Egypt also remember him as an avid amateur photographer who almost always wore a camera around his neck, but never allowed himself to be photographed.

{"premise": "Advocates for the detainees today said the new position is at best a modest departure from Bush policy, but is a public-relations effort to move away from the loaded term \"enemy combatants\" that critics across the world associate with the former president. The brief maintains the US government's ability to hold terrorist suspects without charge, said Tom Malinowski, Washington director of Human Rights Watch, and applies international laws of war to suspects captured far from the battlefields of Afghanistan and Iraq. \"It's a symbolic effort to distance the new administration from the Bush approach,\" he said. \"But they've preserved significant aspects of the previous administration's detention authority.\"", "hypothesis": "Tom Malinowski works for Human Rights Watch.", "idx": 2565}
