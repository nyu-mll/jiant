#!/bin/bash

# Convenience script to execute a command (such as a training script) remotely
# on a worker instance.

# This version creates a tmux session on the remote machine and runs the command
# in it. This gives persistence: if you disconnect from the remote machine, the
# job will continue running.
#
# To exit the tmux session on the remote host, press Ctrl+b followed by the 'd'
# key. To re-attach, you can ssh to the remote host and run:
#   tmux attach -t <job_name>
# Or run this script with the command 'A'
#
# To kill a target job and its associated tmux session, run with the command 'K'.

# Usage: ./remote_job_tmux.sh <instance_name> <job_name> <command> [<zone>]
