#!/bin/bash

# Convenience script to execute a command (such as a training script) remotely
# on a worker instance.

# This is the simple version, which runs "synchronously":
# the current shell controls the process, and hitting Ctrl+C will kill the
# command (as will losing the SSH connection).
# For persistence, use remote_job_tmux.sh

# Usage: ./remote_job.sh <instance_name> <command> [<zone>]
