`jiant` is a work-in-progress software toolkit for natural language processing research, designed to facilitate work on multitask learning and transfer learning for sentence understanding tasks.

A few things you might want to know about `jiant`:

- `jiant` is configuration-driven. You can run an enormous variety of experiments by simply writing configuration files. Of course, if you need to add any major new features, you can also easily edit or extend the code.
- `jiant` contains implementations of strong baselines for the [GLUE](https://gluebenchmark.com) and [SuperGLUE](https://super.gluebenchmark.com/) benchmarks, and it's the recommended starting point for work on these benchmarks.
- `jiant` was developed at [the 2018 JSALT Workshop](https://www.clsp.jhu.edu/workshops/18-workshop/) by [the General-Purpose Sentence Representation Learning](https://jsalt18-sentence-repl.github.io/) team and is maintained by [the NYU Machine Learning for Language Lab](https://wp.nyu.edu/ml2/people/), with help from [many outside collaborators](https://github.com/nyu-mll/jiant/graphs/contributors) (especially Google AI Language's [Ian Tenney](https://ai.google/research/people/IanTenney)).
- `jiant` is built on [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org). It also uses many components from [AllenNLP](https://github.com/allenai/allennlp) and HuggingFace PyTorch [implementations](https://github.com/huggingface/pytorch-pretrained-BERT) of BERT and GPT.
- The name `jiant` doesn't mean much. The 'j' stands for JSALT. That's all the acronym we have.

## Getting Started

To find the setup instructions for using jiant and to run a simple example demo experiment using data from GLUE, follow this [getting started tutorial](https://github.com/nyu-mll/jiant/tree/master/tutorials/setup_tutorial.md)!

## Official Documentation

Our official documentation is here: https://jiant.info/documentation#/


## Running
To run an experiment, make a config file similar to `config/demo.conf` with your model configuration. In addition, you can use the `--overrides` flag to override specific variables. For example:
```sh
python main.py --config_file config/demo.conf \
    --overrides "exp_name = my_exp, run_name = foobar, d_hid = 256"
```
will run the demo config, but output to `$JIANT_PROJECT_PREFIX/my_exp/foobar`.
 To run the demo config, you will have to set environment variables. The best way to achieve that is to follow the instructions in [user_config_template.sh](user_config_template.sh)
*  `$JIANT_PROJECT_PREFIX`: the where the outputs will be saved.
*  `$JIANT_DATA_DIR`: location of the saved data. This is usually the location of the GLUE data in a simple default setup.
*  `$WORD_EMBS_FILE`: location of any word embeddings you want to use (not necessary when using ELMo, GPT, or BERT). You can download GloVe (840B) [here](http://nlp.stanford.edu/data/glove.840B.300d.zip) or fastText (2M) [here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/fasttext-vectors/crawl-300d-2M.vec.zip).
To have `user_config.sh` run automatically, follow instructions in [scripts/export_from_bash.sh](export_from_bash.sh).

## Papers

`jiant` has been used in these three papers so far:

- [Looking for ELMo's Friends: Sentence-Level Pretraining Beyond Language Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.10860)
- [What do you learn from context? Probing for sentence structure in contextualized word representations](https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJzSgnRcKX) ("Edge Probing")
- [Probing What Different NLP Tasks Teach Machines about Function Word Comprehension](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.11544)

To exactly reproduce experiments from [the ELMo's Friends paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.10860) use the [`jsalt-experiments`](https://github.com/jsalt18-sentence-repl/jiant/tree/jsalt-experiments) branch. That will contain a snapshot of the code as of early August, potentially with updated documentation.

For the [edge probing paper](https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJzSgnRcKX), see the [probing/](probing/) directory.


## Getting Help

Post an issue here on GitHub if you have any problems, and create a pull request if you make any improvements (substantial or cosmetic) to the code that you're willing to share.


## Contributing

We use the `black` coding style with a line limit of 100. After installing the requirements, simply running `pre-commit
install` should ensure you comply with this in all your future commits. If you're adding features or fixing a bug,
please also add the tests.
