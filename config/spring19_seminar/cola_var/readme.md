## Config files for experiments using cola(-like) target tasks:

Use `conf_gen.py` to generate
* the config files, named after _evaluation task_ + _model name_;
* the command lines to run main experiments, where each run is named after _model name_ + _pretrain tasks_;
* the command lines to run CoLA-inference experiments, provided the relevant `params.conf` and model files are ready.
