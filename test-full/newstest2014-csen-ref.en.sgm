<seg id="1">A black box in your car?</seg>
<seg id="2">As America's road planners struggle to find the cash to mend a crumbling highway system, many are beginning to see a solution in a little black box that fits neatly by the dashboard of your car.</seg>
<seg id="3">The devices, which track every mile a motorist drives and transmit that information to bureaucrats, are at the center of a controversial attempt in Washington and state planning offices to overhaul the outdated system for funding America's major roads.</seg>
<seg id="4">The usually dull arena of highway planning has suddenly spawned intense debate and colorful alliances.</seg>
<seg id="5">Libertarians have joined environmental groups in lobbying to allow government to use the little boxes to keep track of the miles you drive, and possibly where you drive them - then use the information to draw up a tax bill.</seg>
<seg id="6">The tea party is aghast.</seg>
<seg id="7">The American Civil Liberties Union is deeply concerned, too, raising a variety of privacy issues.</seg>
<seg id="8">And while Congress can't agree on whether to proceed, several states are not waiting.</seg>
<seg id="9">They are exploring how, over the next decade, they can move to a system in which drivers pay per mile of road they roll over.</seg>
<seg id="10">Thousands of motorists have already taken the black boxes, some of which have GPS monitoring, for a test drive.</seg>
<seg id="11">This really is a must for our nation.</seg>
<seg id="12">"It is not a matter of something we might choose to do," said Hasan Ikhrata, executive director of the Southern California Assn. of Governments, which is planning for the state to start tracking miles driven by every California motorist by 2025.</seg>
<seg id="13">There is going to be a change in how we pay these taxes.</seg>
<seg id="14">The technology is there to do it.</seg>
<seg id="15">The push comes as the country's Highway Trust Fund, financed with taxes Americans pay at the gas pump, is broke.</seg>
<seg id="16">Americans don't buy as much gas as they used to.</seg>
<seg id="17">Cars get many more miles to the gallon.</seg>
<seg id="18">The federal tax itself, 18.4 cents per gallon, hasn't gone up in 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="19">Politicians are loath to raise the tax even one penny when gas prices are high.</seg>
<seg id="20">"The gas tax is just not sustainable," said Lee Munnich, a transportation policy expert at the University of Minnesota.</seg>
<seg id="21">His state recently put tracking devices on 500 cars to test out a pay-by-mile system.</seg>
<seg id="22">"This works out as the most logical alternative over the long term," he said.</seg>
<seg id="23">Wonks call it a mileage-based user fee.</seg>
<seg id="24">It is no surprise that the idea appeals to urban liberals, as the taxes could be rigged to change driving patterns in ways that could help reduce congestion and greenhouse gases, for example.</seg>
<seg id="25">California planners are looking to the system as they devise strategies to meet the goals laid out in the state's ambitious global warming laws.</seg>
<seg id="26">But Rep. Bill Shuster (R-Pa.), chairman of the House Transportation Committee, has said he, too, sees it as the most viable long-term alternative.</seg>
<seg id="27">The free marketeers at the Reason Foundation are also fond of having drivers pay per mile.</seg>
<seg id="28">"This is not just a tax going into a black hole," said Adrian Moore, vice president of policy at Reason.</seg>
<seg id="29">People are paying more directly into what they are getting.</seg>
<seg id="30">The movement is also bolstered by two former U.S. Transportation secretaries, who in a 2011 report urged Congress to move in the pay-per-mile direction.</seg>
<seg id="31">The U.S. Senate approved a $90-million pilot project last year that would have involved about 10,000 cars.</seg>
<seg id="32">But the House leadership killed the proposal, acting on concerns of rural lawmakers representing constituents whose daily lives often involve logging lots of miles to get to work or into town.</seg>
<seg id="33">Several states and cities are nonetheless moving ahead on their own.</seg>
<seg id="34">The most eager is Oregon, which is enlisting 5,000 drivers in the country's biggest experiment.</seg>
<seg id="35">Those drivers will soon pay the mileage fees instead of gas taxes to the state.</seg>
<seg id="36">Nevada has already completed a pilot.</seg>
<seg id="37">New York City is looking into one.</seg>
<seg id="38">Illinois is trying it on a limited basis with trucks.</seg>
<seg id="39">And the I-95 Coalition, which includes 17 state transportation departments along the Eastern Seaboard (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida), is studying how they could go about implementing the change.</seg>
<seg id="40">The concept is not a universal hit.</seg>
<seg id="41">In Nevada, where about 50 volunteers' cars were equipped with the devices not long ago, drivers were uneasy about the government being able to monitor their every move.</seg>
<seg id="42">"Concerns about Big Brother and those sorts of things were a major problem," said Alauddin Khan, who directs strategic and performance management at the Nevada Department of Transportation.</seg>
<seg id="43">It was not something people wanted.</seg>
<seg id="44">As the trial got underway, the ACLU of Nevada warned on its website: "It would be fairly easy to turn these devices into full-fledged tracking devices."</seg>
<seg id="45">There is no need to build an enormous, unwieldy technological infrastructure that will inevitably be expanded to keep records of individuals' everyday comings and goings.</seg>
<seg id="46">Nevada is among several states now scrambling to find affordable technology that would allow the state to keep track of how many miles a car is being driven, but not exactly where and at what time.</seg>
<seg id="47">If you can do that, Khan said, the public gets more comfortable.</seg>
<seg id="48">The hunt for that technology has led some state agencies to a small California startup called True Mileage.</seg>
<seg id="49">The firm was not originally in the business of helping states tax drivers.</seg>
<seg id="50">It was seeking to break into an emerging market in auto insurance, in which drivers would pay based on their mileage.</seg>
<seg id="51">But the devices it is testing appeal to highway planners because they don't use GPS and deliver a limited amount of information, uploaded periodically by modem.</seg>
<seg id="52">"People will be more willing to do this if you do not track their speed and you do not track their location," said Ryan Morrison, chief executive of True Mileage.</seg>
<seg id="53">There have been some big mistakes in some of these state pilot programs.</seg>
<seg id="54">There are a lot less expensive and less intrusive ways to do this.</seg>
<seg id="55">In Oregon, planners are experimenting with giving drivers different choices.</seg>
<seg id="56">They can choose a device with or without GPS.</seg>
<seg id="57">Or they can choose not to have a device at all, opting instead to pay a flat fee based on the average number of miles driven by all state residents.</seg>
<seg id="58">Other places are hoping to sell the concept to a wary public by having the devices do more, not less.</seg>
<seg id="59">In New York City, transportation officials are seeking to develop a taxing device that would also be equipped to pay parking meter fees, provide "pay-as-you-drive" insurance, and create a pool of real-time speed data from other drivers that motorists could use to avoid traffic.</seg>
<seg id="60">"Motorists would be attracted to participate because of the value of the benefits it offers to them," says a city planning document.</seg>
<seg id="61">Some transportation planners, though, wonder if all the talk about paying by the mile is just a giant distraction.</seg>
<seg id="62">At the Metropolitan Transportation Commission in the San Francisco Bay Area, officials say Congress could very simply deal with the bankrupt Highway Trust Fund by raising gas taxes.</seg>
<seg id="63">An extra one-time or annual levy could be imposed on drivers of hybrids and others whose vehicles don't use much gas, so they pay their fair share.</seg>
<seg id="64">"There is no need for radical surgery when all you need to do is take an aspirin," said Randy Rentschler, the commission's director of legislation and public affairs.</seg>
<seg id="65">If we do this, hundreds of millions of drivers will be concerned about their privacy and a host of other things.</seg>

<seg id="1">Sobotka negotiating for ČSSD.</seg>
<seg id="2">Social democracy is crumbling; the Christian Democrats and Babiš’s ANO are holding talks and planning a common approach.</seg>
<seg id="3">If the Social Democrats can pull themselves together in several weeks, they will sit at the negotiating table with perfectly well coordinated partners, who will bring to the table a completed list of demands including ministerial posts.</seg>
<seg id="4">The ČSSD envoys will then either eat up the sour coalition grapes or give a nod to an unstable minority government.</seg>
<seg id="5">After four days being carried on a wave of sympathy, Bohuslav Sobotka got into hot water for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="6">He failed yesterday to gain control over the political board and most importantly to persuade the confirmed liars to resign.</seg>
<seg id="7">So far he is the only confirmed negotiator for the party; the other members of the team will only be allowed after the key meeting of the Central Executive Committee (CEC).</seg>
<seg id="8">I have apologised to members of the board and now to the citizens as well.</seg>
<seg id="9">We shouldn’t lie, in our private lives or in public.</seg>
<seg id="10">"It was a mistake," said Michal Hašek after a meeting of the Social Democrats’ senior leadership.</seg>
<seg id="11">He added that he would not be clinging to the first deputy chairman post.</seg>
<seg id="12">"I’ll announce my decision on 10 November at the Central Executive Committee," said Hašek.</seg>
<seg id="13">Deputy chairman of ČSSD Zdeněk Škromach and head of the parliamentary club Jeroným Tejc said something similar.</seg>
<seg id="14">He did point out, however, that he had only been elected two days earlier.</seg>
<seg id="15">Both MPs then declared that they would do everything so that the 50-member ČSSD club would speak in one voice.</seg>
<seg id="16">Michal Hašek crowned this absurd theatre with the sentence: "I have been a member of ČSSD for 15 years. I have always been loyal to the brand and respected the decisions of party authorities."</seg>
<seg id="17">In other words, another lie broadcast live.</seg>
<seg id="18">Or perhaps with the call for Sobotka’s resignation and his exclusion from the negotiating team he forgot that the August CEC, with 57 per cent majority, agreed to Bohuslav Sobotka being the party’s candidate for prime minister?</seg>
<seg id="19">The ČSSD head has however made himself a powerful army of enemies by only convening the CEC for the next Sunday.</seg>
<seg id="20">His opponents have ten days to flood with emails the 192 members of this body and the media with a whole load of gossip and rumours, or to remind them of the real mistakes in Sobotka’s political career.</seg>
<seg id="21">Dirty laundry will be washed strongly, with the dark signs of the alliance appearing between the coal baron Zdeňek Bakala and Sobotka’s wing.</seg>
<seg id="22">The friendly relationship between Bohuslav Sobotka and the influential lawyer Radek Pokorný will be discussed.</seg>
<seg id="23">Disputes will bubble up in the South Moravian and Moravian-Silesian organisation of ČSSD.</seg>
<seg id="24">The Ostrava mayor and Sobotka's ally Petr Kajnar issued these words of warning: "I've signed Charter 77 so that the country wouldn’t be ruled by idiots."</seg>
<seg id="25">If the CEC were to meet this weekend, the liars would probably be forced to sacrifice ritually their posts.</seg>
<seg id="26">The traitors will put on their sackcloth and ashes and remain. put</seg>
<seg id="27">And then the currently winning head of ČSSD will end up with the nickname Bohuslav Pyrrha.</seg>

<seg id="1">Martin Doktor on the problems with the Olympic Games in Sochi: Communication with the Russians is challenging</seg>
<seg id="2">The corners of his mouth indicate a small smile and then he just takes a deep breath: "It’s challenging."</seg>
<seg id="3">Cooperation with the organising team for the Sochi 2014 Olympics is a little more complicated according to Martin Doktor.</seg>
<seg id="4">We can forget about how it was in the last Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="5">"Nothing works the same way," says the head of the Czech Olympic mission.</seg>
<seg id="6">What exactly is happening?</seg>
<seg id="7">A lot of things work more slowly and not so precisely.</seg>
<seg id="8">It is kind of confusing.</seg>
<seg id="9">In terms of invoices, they are relatively quick, in terms of supplying information on essential things, they are not so good.</seg>
<seg id="10">For instance, we’ve spent three months trying to get them to tell us how they will officially identify the separate villages, so we can do all sorts of things in accordance with that.</seg>
<seg id="11">We’re still waiting and they keep saying that they’ll let us know.</seg>
<seg id="12">In many ways, they are always communicating.</seg>
<seg id="13">Is the Olympic village built at least?</seg>
<seg id="14">But it’s no longer a catastrophic situation.</seg>
<seg id="15">A month ago we were walking around empty rooms.</seg>
<seg id="16">The houses are standing fortunately.</seg>
<seg id="17">What does it mean, they are empty?</seg>
<seg id="18">Are the floors done, for example?</seg>
<seg id="19">Just the basic concrete floors, at least that is what it was like a month ago.</seg>
<seg id="20">But they still have time.</seg>
<seg id="21">Even though there is a danger that when we turn up on 26 January as the vanguard, we will still be able to smell the glue.</seg>
<seg id="22">And if they don’t manage it, what will there be?</seg>
<seg id="23">Do you think President Putin would bring in the army?</seg>
<seg id="24">That's exactly what will probably happen.</seg>
<seg id="25">As long as the Olympic villages are not Potemkin villages.</seg>
<seg id="26">It’s more likely that they won’t be able to fix the roads, for example, they won’t get the details finished.</seg>
<seg id="27">Maybe the roads will be in such a state that we’ll have to take our wellies from the London games.</seg>
<seg id="28">But I believe they’ll get it together somehow.</seg>
<seg id="29">How many Czech athletes could be going to Sochi?</seg>
<seg id="30">At the moment there are about 78 of them, although depending on nomination criteria, that number varies.</seg>
<seg id="31">Say, the figure skaters will probably go in the trio they ended up in.</seg>
<seg id="32">There is no doubt about the skater Martina Sáblíková, but otherwise it is still in development stages.</seg>
<seg id="33">Have you got another trip to Sochi planned?</seg>
<seg id="34">No, as long as nothing happens, I won’t be flying out until 26 January.</seg>
<seg id="35">We know what the houses in the Olympic village will look like.</seg>
<seg id="36">We’ve even measured certain things ourselves, so we don’t just put our faith in the sketches.</seg>
<seg id="37">We are also planning a whole range of other things, including transport.</seg>
<seg id="38">And what is the head of the mission doing 100 days before the Olympic Games?</seg>
<seg id="39">I’m preparing for the annual assessment of individual Olympic sports plus I’m working on my normal agenda in the sense of communicating with the organising committee in Sochi.</seg>

<seg id="1">Putin promises green Olympics, his plan scuppered by huge, secret landfills</seg>
<seg id="2">Fans of winter sports are already counting down the days to the start of the Olympic Games in Sochi, but others are watching their preparation with growing concern.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Russian Olympics, although they do not start until February, are facing another scandal.</seg>
<seg id="4">Apparently the Russians are not managing to fulfil promises that the preparations and holding of the games will in no way disturb nature in the Krasnodar Region at the foot of the Caucasus Mountains, where thousands of athletes and tens of thousands of visitors will be heading in four months’ time.</seg>
<seg id="5">Indeed, after the Vancouver Olympics, the Russians had the bar set very high; the Canadian games went down in Olympic history as the most environmentally friendly.</seg>
<seg id="6">It seems, however, that Russian president Vladimir Putin’s commitment to organise games with "zero waste" ended a long time ago.</seg>
<seg id="7">AP reporters last week discovered a giant landfill of construction materials in the village of Akhshtyr, not far from Sochi.</seg>
<seg id="8">Back in August, ecologists found and immediately reported a landfill full of construction materials, tyres, canisters and insulation foam.</seg>
<seg id="9">The Russian authorities apologised and the landfill disappeared.</seg>
<seg id="10">But not for long.</seg>
<seg id="11">Last week, reporters were presented with a view of a landfill the size of three football pitches.</seg>
<seg id="12">It was not the only one – several such sites have surfaced in the area, according to British newspaper The Times.</seg>
<seg id="13">Russian Railways, a state monopoly, which is building approximately a sixty-kilometre track between the airport in Sochi and the sports resort, is working on the site.</seg>
<seg id="14">The company, which has already swallowed up 280 billion roubles, is headed by one of Putin’s close associates, Vladimir Yakunin.</seg>
<seg id="15">In August the railways defended themselves, saying the landfill was started by one of the subcontractors.</seg>
<seg id="16">But local residents are desperate.</seg>
<seg id="17">According to the residents of Akhshtyr, trucks have been driving around the village filled with waste materials day and night for three months.</seg>
<seg id="18">According to experts, there is a risk that the waste is contaminating the local river Mzymta, other streams and the Black Sea.</seg>
<seg id="19">"Water from here will contaminate Sochi’s water sources for the next ten to fifteen years," Vladimir Kimayev from the non-profit environmental organisation EWNC told the British paper.</seg>
<seg id="20">Illegal landfills are not the only problem for the Russian organising committee and the government.</seg>
<seg id="21">The most expensive Olympics in history, they are just one long tunnel according to the opposition.</seg>
<seg id="22">To compare: the Sochi games will cost 51 billion dollars, while the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing came to 43 billion.</seg>
<seg id="23">Last year’s games in London cost just 19 billion and the Vancouver games nine billion.</seg>
<seg id="24">Aside from the corruption scandals, project delays and fear of whether there will eventually be enough snow, reports have also appeared that when working on construction of the sports venues and infrastructure, the human rights have not been observed.</seg>
<seg id="25">Last month, one of the workers sewed his mouth shut in protest at not being paid for two months.</seg>
<seg id="26">Many people are also concerned about how the Russian organisers will cope with the new law banning the promotion of homosexuality.</seg>
<seg id="27">Some visitors are planning to support Russian gays at the Olympics.</seg>

<seg id="1">Young couple take advantage of living with parents, the new house offers privacy to both generations</seg>
<seg id="2">Japanese studio Tai and Associates was given the task of designing a house on a plot lying on the corner of two streets, where the ground itself is slightly sloping.</seg>
<seg id="3">The request also said that there would be two generations living in the house who wanted to live together but at the same time each should have their own clearly separate space.</seg>
<seg id="4">The young couple also needed a small office.</seg>
<seg id="5">The house stands on the corner of two streets and on slightly sloping land.</seg>
<seg id="6">Architects therefore decided to put each household on one floor of the house.</seg>
<seg id="7">"In creating the design we respected the family ties, history and memories associated with the site."</seg>
<seg id="8">"Three separate functions of the house are connected with several paths through the exterior of the object, so they are all aware of the presence of the others, but they still have their privacy," explain the designers.</seg>
<seg id="9">The parents’ household is on the garden level with an old pine tree, to which family traditions and memories are linked.</seg>
<seg id="10">The separate parts of the house are easily recognisable from outside; they differ with the varied final finish of the façades.</seg>
<seg id="11">While the main segment of the building is made of concrete, the surface was made using panels of planks; the part where the office is, is whitewashed, and the remaining elements remained pure concrete with no further modifications.</seg>
<seg id="12">Many walls of the house are completely glazed, thanks to which the interior of the house is strongly connected with the exterior.</seg>
<seg id="13">The parents’ household, more precisely the kitchen, dining room and living room, is surrounded by a small garden with tree, which has great significance for the family.</seg>
<seg id="14">The connection of the interior with the exterior is highlighted with a side wall which starts in the garden and continues all the way to the living room.</seg>
<seg id="15">The kitchen space in the young couple’s household.</seg>
<seg id="16">The young couple enter the house by the main entrance to the hall and from there they go up the stairs to their space.</seg>
<seg id="17">The stairs are actually a dominant feature of the interior of the house.</seg>
<seg id="18">Their construction allows plenty of natural light to fall through them in cascades.</seg>
<seg id="19">This is how the architects tried to differentiate the house from others and impart something unique to it.</seg>
<seg id="20">The household of the young couple is treated as a single open space with a kitchen section, dining room and living room together.</seg>
<seg id="21">It is separated from the terrace by a glass wall with sliding doors.</seg>
<seg id="22">The living zone with the dining room and kitchen section in the household of the young couple.</seg>
<seg id="23">The second floor is composed as one large, open space, which freely goes to the terrace, from which there is a lovely view of Tokyo Bay.</seg>
<seg id="24">The separate office on the top floor is designed in a clean combination of white and black.</seg>
<seg id="25">The staircase is a dominant feature of the house’s interior.</seg>
<seg id="26">The young couple enter the house by the main entrance, find themselves in the entrance hall, and from there climb up the stairs.</seg>

<seg id="1">Defend academic freedom, it applies to Zeman and the ODS.</seg>
<seg id="2">In recent months, through open letters, I have repeatedly urged students, educators and heads of secondary schools and universities in several regions to defend academic freedom against the election campaign carried out at schools by president Miloš Zeman.</seg>
<seg id="3">I met with varying degrees of success.</seg>
<seg id="4">In return, the Rector of Masaryk University in Brno, who declined a lecture from the honorary chairman of SPOZ – Zeman’s people in the pre-election period, was not invited to the celebration of the national day of the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="5">Here is a list of school representatives who were not so brave and allowed Miloš Zeman to visit: Brno University of Technology, Hladnov Grammar School in Ostrava, Business School Ostrava, Kolín Business Academy, Jan Evangelista Purkyně University in Ústí nad Labem.</seg>
<seg id="6">Now in Pardubice we are encountering the continuation of promoting the policy at universities.</seg>
<seg id="7">The newly elected ODS MP, dean of the Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at the University of Pardubice, Simeon Karamazov, is refusing to step down from his academic post and he thinks this is normal.</seg>
<seg id="8">Professor Karamazov, it really is not the same thing as you were staying, for example, in the post of mayor of a small town.</seg>
<seg id="9">Do you want to join the ranks of ČSSD governors who are holding the posts of MP and governor at the same time and just like them degrade both occupations?</seg>
<seg id="10">In this way you are telling people that handling both these challenging posts is a piece of cake.</seg>
<seg id="11">I know, we have the example of Michal Hašek here, who can actually handle several dozen posts at once.</seg>
<seg id="12">That is not exactly the example of a person you should follow, however.</seg>
<seg id="13">We can also find a contrasting and positive example of Doctor Štěpánka Fraňková, who preferred to leave her post as MP so she could devote herself fully to leading the city of Pardubice.</seg>
<seg id="14">The main reason for my recommendation to leave the post of dean, however, is that holding the concurrent posts, you are breaching the apolitical nature of the academic environment of the University of Pardubice.</seg>
<seg id="15">The leadership of the Pardubice ODS see your current work in both posts as an advantage for the university.</seg>
<seg id="16">However, you will be able to help "your" school even without remaining dean.</seg>
<seg id="17">I think your students will also have a similar opinion as I have and Rector Miroslav Ludwig.</seg>
<seg id="18">Consider your resignation therefore again, and save face.</seg>
<seg id="19">Otherwise it may happen that your days will be numbered in the next election.</seg>
<seg id="20">And it might not take that long.</seg>

<seg id="2">Slovácká Fruta Kunovice, which is a part of the food processing group Hamé, wants to produce over one thousand tonnes of sauerkraut in the following months.</seg>
<seg id="3">The season began here in October and will last for around six months.</seg>
<seg id="4">They have been making healthy snacks here since 1925, still using the traditional method of treading directly in large tanks.</seg>
<seg id="5">In the modern industrial age it is a rarity.</seg>
<seg id="6">Our staff tread a route of almost ten kilometres per shift.</seg>
<seg id="7">In each of the ten tanks you can fit fifteen to thirty tonnes of cabbage, filling one takes three shifts," says director of the Slovácká Fruta factory David Kladroba.</seg>
<seg id="8">The cabbage is brought to the  factory directly from the company's fields by farmers mainly from Ostrožsko and Břeclavsko regions.</seg>
<seg id="9">Fruta staff then clean the vegetables, remove the stalks and throw them into the cutting machine.</seg>
<seg id="10">From there, the cut cabbage falls into six-metre deep pools, in which our treaders work tirelessly, dressed in white clothes and boots.</seg>
<seg id="11">This displaces the unwanted air.</seg>
<seg id="12">The last trodden layer of cabbage is covered with a tarpaulin and weighed down with water.</seg>
<seg id="13">"The cut cabbage is then matured for six to eight weeks undergoing spontaneous lactic fermentation with no added substances to support the fermentation," emphasises Kladroba.</seg>
<seg id="14">The natural process matches production process at home, with staff sprinkling salt and caraway seeds on the individual layers.</seg>
<seg id="15">After fermentation, the cabbage goes to the filling line.</seg>
<seg id="16">It is packaged in a sweet and sour pickling liquid in bags or jars and undergoes sterilisation.</seg>
<seg id="17">Hamé group supplies sauerkraut mainly to the domestic and Slovak markets.</seg>
<seg id="18">There is also interest registered in several other countries, such as the United Kingdom, Ireland and Canada.</seg>

<seg id="2">Edward Snowden, the US intelligence whistleblower, has declared that he is willing to travel to Berlin to give evidence to the German parliament if the US National Security Agency and its director Keith Alexander fail to provide answers about its activities.</seg>
<seg id="3">German MP Hans-Christian Ströbele on Thursday met Mr Snowden in Russia, where he has been granted asylum, to discuss him testifying in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="4">A letter from Mr Snowden, presented to the media in Berlin on Friday by the MP, said: "Though the outcome of my efforts has been demonstrably positive, my government continues to treat dissent as defection, and seeks to criminalise political speech with felony charges that provide no defence."</seg>
<seg id="5">However, speaking the truth is not a crime.</seg>
<seg id="6">In the letter, Mr Snowden said he believed the support of the international community could persuade the US government to abandon criminal charges against him.</seg>
<seg id="7">The charges filed by the US justice department include espionage and theft of government property.</seg>
<seg id="8">Hans-Peter Friedrich, German interior minister, told Zeit Online: "If Mr Snowden is ready to speak to German officials, we will find ways to make this possible."</seg>
<seg id="9">Relations between the US and Germany have come under strain following claims that the NSA bugged Chancellor Angela's Merkel's phone.</seg>
<seg id="10">Thomas Oppermann, the MP who heads the parliamentary panel that oversees intelligence, said that if there were an opportunity to hear Mr Snowden as a witness "without bringing him into danger and completely ruining relations with the US," it should be taken.</seg>
<seg id="11">Mr Ströbele, an MP for Germany's Green party, published a picture of himself with Mr Snowden on his Twitter feed.</seg>
<seg id="12">He was accompanied on his visit to Russia by two German journalists.</seg>

<seg id="14">If Mr Snowden testified in Germany he would need assurances that he would be "safe" there, the MP said.</seg>

<seg id="1">We are sorry about the killing, but we are innocent, say representatives of Khmer Rouge</seg>
<seg id="2">Nuon Chea was number two in the hierarchy of the Khmer Rouge and Khieu Samphan is the former head of state.</seg>
<seg id="3">During the government of the Khmer Rouge, which in the years from 1975 to 1979 was based on a mixture of Maoism and nationalism, more than three million Cambodians lost their lives as a result of exhaustion, hunger, disease, torture and executions, at least a quarter of the population at the time.</seg>
<seg id="4">The International Criminal Tribunal for Cambodia sentenced this commander of the notorious S-21 prison to life in 2010.</seg>
<seg id="5">Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan are accused of genocide and crimes against humanity, including torture, enslavement and murder.</seg>
<seg id="6">Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan claimed that they believed they were acting in the best interest of the nation and they had no idea what the real extent of the killing was.</seg>
<seg id="7">"It’s easy to say that I should have known everything, understood everything and intervened and fixed the situation," said Khieu Samphan on Thursday before the court.</seg>
<seg id="8">Do you really think I wanted this to happen to my people?</seg>
<seg id="9">The fact is that I had no power," he added.</seg>
<seg id="10">Nuon Chea said that he never ordered Khmer Rouge cadres to "mistreat or kill people, to deny them food or commit genocide."</seg>
<seg id="11">He did, however, admit "moral responsibility" for the dead.</seg>
<seg id="12">"I would like to sincerely apologise to the public, the victims, their families, all the Cambodian people," he said.</seg>
<seg id="13">Fifty-five year old Bin Sivla, who lost eleven relatives in the Khmer Rouge regime, told the AFP that she cannot accept Nuon Chea’s apology."</seg>

<seg id="1">Frontier Airlines to charge for carry-on baggage</seg>
<seg id="2">Frontier Airlines plans to charge up to $100 for passengers to store carry-on luggage on board their flight.</seg>
<seg id="3">Frontier Airlines plans to start charging up to $100 for a carry-on bag and $2 for coffee or soda, although its announcement on Wednesday did say that passengers will get to keep the whole can.</seg>
<seg id="4">The new carry-on fee is for bags in the overhead bin, so small bags under the seat will still be free.</seg>
<seg id="5">Frontier said it will charge $25 if the fee is paid in advance, $100 if travelers wait to pay until they're at the gate.</seg>
<seg id="6">Frontier spokeswoman Kate O'Malley said the $100 fee is to get travelers to take care of the charge in advance.</seg>
<seg id="7">"We don't want to charge that," she said.</seg>
<seg id="8">Airlines began charging for the first and second checked bags in 2008.</seg>
<seg id="9">Passengers trying to avoid those fees have been stuffing as much as they can into carry-on baggage stashed in overhead bins, meaning those bins often run out of space.</seg>
<seg id="10">Fees are one way to get passengers to bring less on board.</seg>
<seg id="11">O'Malley said the new charge is not really about raising money.</seg>
<seg id="12">It's about Frontier's most loyal customers making it very clear that finding overhead bin space has become increasingly difficult.</seg>
<seg id="13">Passengers who buy their tickets on the airline's website won't have to pay.</seg>
<seg id="14">That means one passenger in line at a Frontier gate might get to bring a bag on for free, while the next person in line might owe $100 for a similar bag.</seg>
<seg id="15">O'Malley said Frontier's website and check-in procedures are being changed to make sure passengers know about the fee before they get to the gate.</seg>
<seg id="16">Frontier's new carry-on fee won't start until summer, though a date hasn't been set.</seg>
<seg id="17">Passengers often grumble about baggage charges and other fees, but airlines love them.</seg>
<seg id="18">They argue that luggage costs money to handle, and passengers who want the service should pay for it.</seg>
<seg id="19">Many on Wall Street view the addition of baggage fees as a sign that airlines are charging enough money to cover the cost of air travel after years of losses.</seg>
<seg id="20">Most haven't touched carry-on bag fees, though.</seg>
<seg id="21">Spirit Airlines Inc. started the first carry-on fee three years ago, and fellow discounter Allegiant Air later followed.</seg>
<seg id="22">The only other airline with such a fee is Hungary's Wizz Air, said airline consultant Jay Sorensen, who closely tracks add-on fees.</seg>
<seg id="23">He estimated in a December 2011 report that Spirit's carry-on fee brings in $50 million a year.</seg>
<seg id="24">Sorensen, a former executive with Midwest Airlines, flew Spirit recently and wondered what he'd find at the gate as passengers encountered Spirit's unusual carry-on bag fee.</seg>
<seg id="25">"The boarding process was the smoothest I had seen in my airline career," he said.</seg>
<seg id="26">I was expecting to see gnashing of teeth and a fight breaking out at the gate.</seg>
<seg id="27">The plane was full, he said, "and it boarded lickety-split."</seg>
<seg id="28">Frontier is also following Spirit's $2 charge for coffee, tea, soda, or juice.</seg>
<seg id="29">Frontier said passengers who get soda or juice can keep the whole can, and it will give coffee refills for free.</seg>
<seg id="30">It will still give away water.</seg>
<seg id="31">US Airways briefly tried charging for beverages in 2008 but backed down seven months later after passengers complained and no other major airline followed.</seg>
<seg id="32">Frontier's move to charge the carry-on fee if passengers don't buy direct from the airline is its latest effort to steer customers toward its own website.</seg>
<seg id="33">Airlines pay online travel sellers such as Orbitz $10 to $25 for each ticket sold.</seg>
<seg id="34">That has given all airlines an incentive to steer passengers to buy directly from them instead of going through an online travel agency.</seg>
<seg id="35">Frontier has gone the furthest in this area, though.</seg>
<seg id="36">In September it began giving half as many frequent flier miles to customers who bought through an online travel agency.</seg>
<seg id="37">On Wednesday it slashed the mileage award to 25 percent of the miles of the trip.</seg>
<seg id="38">So, a 1,000 mile Frontier trip purchased from an online travel agency would earn 250 miles.</seg>
<seg id="39">It also allows passengers to choose their seat in advance only if they buy directly from the Frontier website.</seg>
<seg id="40">Frontier has a loyal base of customers in its home city of Denver, but its business is shrinking and losing money.</seg>
<seg id="41">Revenue dropped 9 percent and its flying capacity shrank almost 13 percent in the first quarter, according to financial results released Wednesday by corporate parent Republic Airways Holdings Inc.</seg>
<seg id="42">Republic has been trying to fix Frontier's finances as part of selling the airline.</seg>

<seg id="1">NSA Blames "Internal Error," Not Hackers, For Website Crash</seg>
<seg id="2">The shadowy National Security Agency said late Friday that it was a glitch that brought down its public website for a few hours, not hackers as some claimed online.</seg>
<seg id="3">"NSA.gov was not accessible for several hours tonight because of an internal error that occurred during a scheduled update," the spy agency said in an emailed statement.</seg>
<seg id="4">The issue will be resolved this evening.</seg>
<seg id="5">Claims that the outage was caused by a distributed denial of service [DDoS] attack are not true.</seg>
<seg id="6">Earlier this evening online server trackers noted the NSA's website had been down for at least six hours, and the site continues to be inaccessible for some users.</seg>
<seg id="7">Earlier an NSA spokesperson told ABC News the agency's internal, sensitive network was "not at all" compromised.</seg>
<seg id="8">No classified information is in danger, the spokesperson said.</seg>
<seg id="9">At least one hacktivist group online claimed that they were responsible for bringing down the NSA site with a DDoS attack.</seg>
<seg id="10">DDoS attacks are designed to flood a target website with traffic until the servers are overloaded and the site collapses.</seg>
<seg id="11">The cyber tactic is a relatively unsophisticated one and the attacks are not meant to penetrate the internal network of the target system.</seg>
<seg id="12">The formerly super secretive NSA, once nicknamed No Such Agency, has found itself in very public light, and amid vicious criticism, in past months following a stream of revelations about is vast foreign and domestic surveillance programs - collectively the product of secret NSA files stolen from the agency and leaked by disenchanted former NSA contractor Edward Snowden.</seg>
<seg id="13">Such growing controversy surrounding the agency prompted early speculation that tonight's incident was the result of a targeted cyber operation.</seg>

<seg id="1">Bombardier profit dips as plane deliveries, orders fall</seg>
<seg id="2">Canadian plane and train maker Bombardier Inc reported a 15 percent fall in net profit on Thursday, pressured by fewer aircraft orders and deliveries in the third quarter and contract issues in its train unit.</seg>
<seg id="3">Montreal-based Bombardier also did not release any flight test data for its brand-new CSeries aircraft or offer an update on whether the plane will meet its ambitious schedule of going into commercial service by next September.</seg>
<seg id="4">After the test plane's inaugural flight about a month and a half ago, it has only flown three more times, raising questions over whether the testing phase is on track.</seg>
<seg id="5">Results fell short of forecasts and sent shares sliding more than 8 percent on the Toronto Stock Exchange.</seg>
<seg id="6">Cameron Doerksen, an analyst with National Bank Financial, lowered his rating to "sector perform" from "outperform" on Thursday with the view that the stock has limited upside over the next one or two quarters.</seg>
<seg id="7">"While the weaker aircraft deliveries were mostly anticipated, we are clearly disappointed by the margin performance in transportation," Doerksen said in a client note.</seg>
<seg id="8">We believe that Bombardier will receive new orders for the CSeries as the flight test program progresses.</seg>
<seg id="9">However, if no new orders are announced in the coming months, we suspect that the market will become more skeptical of the program.</seg>
<seg id="10">Bombardier hopes the CSeries aircraft family can catapult it into the low end of a market now dominated by Boeing and Airbus.</seg>
<seg id="11">The first test plane was unveiled in March and took flight for the first time in September after months of delays.</seg>
<seg id="12">But firm orders for the CSeries are moderate so far at 177 as potential buyers wait for flight test results to validate the company's claims about the new jetliner's fuel efficiency and cost savings potential.</seg>
<seg id="13">There are currently 403 total orders and commitments with 15 customers and operators.</seg>
<seg id="14">Chief Executive Officer Pierre Beaudoin was confident Bombardier would meet its 300 firm order target by the time the first jet is put into commercial use.</seg>
<seg id="15">Executives also reassured analysts and media on Thursday the program was progressing according to schedule.</seg>
<seg id="16">"The test plane didn't stay on the ground longer than anticipated," Beaudoin said in a conference call, adding that ground tests and software updates were scheduled during the plane's downtime.</seg>
<seg id="17">Every manufacturer schedules it in a different way.</seg>
<seg id="18">We had decided to do a first flight and to do an update period and that's what we have done.</seg>
<seg id="19">That will happen all through the flight program.</seg>
<seg id="20">The second of five test planes is expected to take flight in the coming weeks, with the remainder following shortly after, the company said.</seg>
<seg id="21">Still, analysts are skeptical the first customer can begin operating a CSeries plane 12 months after its maiden flight.</seg>
<seg id="22">Bombardier said it was evaluating the entry-into-service (EIS) schedule and will provide an update in the next few months.</seg>
<seg id="23">"This slow pace of flight testing - although in line with Bombardier's internal schedule apparently - reinforces our view that entry-into-service will be pushed to Q1/15," said Doerksen.</seg>
<seg id="24">For the third quarter ended September 30, Bombardier's net profit fell to $147 million, or 8 cents per share, from $172 million, or 9 cents per share a year earlier.</seg>
<seg id="25">Adjusted earnings per share were unchanged at 9 cents.</seg>
<seg id="26">Revenue dipped marginally to $4.1 billion from $4.2 billion.</seg>
<seg id="27">Analysts had expected earnings of 10 cents per share and revenue of $4.56 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.</seg>
<seg id="28">The world's fourth-largest planemaker said it delivered 45 aircraft during the quarter, down from 57 a year earlier.</seg>
<seg id="29">Net orders fell to 26 aircraft, from 83.</seg>
<seg id="30">The backlog in the aerospace division was $32.9 billion as of September 30, unchanged from December 31.</seg>
<seg id="31">"In aerospace, results were in line with our guidance, but the low order intake and overall market conditions were a disappointment," Beaudoin said.</seg>
<seg id="32">Aerospace revenue fell 13 percent to $2 billion.</seg>
<seg id="33">Bombardier, the world's largest trainmaker, said revenue in that division rose nearly 11 percent to $2.1 billion.</seg>
<seg id="34">The order backlog in the transportation unit was $32.6 billion as of September 30, up marginally from December 31.</seg>
<seg id="35">The transportation division's margins were affected by execution issues in a few large contracts.</seg>
<seg id="36">Executives said new guidance would be provided in the fourth quarter.</seg>
<seg id="37">Shares of Bombardier, which also announced that Google Inc Chief Financial Officer Patrick Pichette would join the board, were down 8.5 percent at C$4.83 in mid afternoon trading on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="38">Brazil's Embraer SA, the world's third-largest commercial planemaker and Bombardier's closest rival, reported a 10 percent fall in quarterly profit on Thursday.</seg>

<seg id="1">Cocaine-addict lawyer who tipped off Mr Big about police investigation is jailed</seg>
<seg id="2">Basharat Ditta, 42, would feed information to crime lord Neil Scarbrough</seg>
<seg id="3">The solicitor feared his secret drug addiction would be exposed</seg>
<seg id="4">Was given a three-year prison sentence at Liverpool Crown Court</seg>
<seg id="5">A top defence lawyer who told a drugs Mr Big about a major police investigation, because he feared his secret drug addiction would be exposed, has been jailed for three years.</seg>
<seg id="6">Basharat Ditta, 42, would feed sensitive intelligence to crime lord Neil Scarbrough about inquiries into his drug trafficking activities after he became compromised by his cocaine habit.</seg>
<seg id="7">The solicitor, who was nicknamed "Bash" and hailed by criminals as a "top brief," was arrested at his home in 2011 following a police surveillance operation into Scarborough, who he had represented in a previous narcotics trial.</seg>
<seg id="8">Officers spotted Sarborough, 32, dropping off three bags of cocaine at the lawyer's home in Blackburn, Lancashire, while he was out at a Law Society dinner with colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="9">Inquiries revealed Ditta was a "regular user" of the Class A drug after tests found traces of cocaine in his hair, on his wallet and on his credit cards.</seg>
<seg id="10">Over an eight month period between January and August 2011 he sought to illicitly obtain information on the arrests of two men on behalf of Scarborough as well as one of his associates.</seg>
<seg id="11">All four suspects were being watched by police at the time as part of a major investigation into a heroin and cocaine racket operating across Lancashire, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.</seg>
<seg id="12">They and 32 other men were later jailed after police seized heroin and cocaine worth £1.5million along with more than £200,000 in cash during a series of raids.</seg>
<seg id="13">Ditta, 42, fed information to criminals because of fears his cocaine addiction would be exposed</seg>
<seg id="14">Today at Liverpool Crown Court Ditta, who works at law firm Forbes Solicitors, based in Blackburn, was facing disgrace after being found guilty of two counts of perverting the course of justice following a three week trial at Liverpool Crown Court.</seg>
<seg id="15">He admitted cocaine possession at an earlier hearing.</seg>
<seg id="16">The lawyer's downfall came after police investigating Scarborough discovered he had been in regular phone contact with Ditta in February 2011.</seg>
<seg id="17">Two detectives trailed the suspect and spotted him arriving at Ditta's house in and was seen to place the drugs which had a purity of 60 per cent under the lawyer's bins in a black golf glove.</seg>
<seg id="18">Soon after the drop off, Scarborough was in regular phone contact with Ditta who had been out at the dinner at the Blackburn Rovers football stadium, Ewood Park.</seg>
<seg id="19">The lawyer returned home to discover the drugs and there were nine communications between them.</seg>
<seg id="20">The court heard Ditta was a "regular user" of cocaine after tests found traces of the Class A drug in his hair, wallet and on his credit cards</seg>
<seg id="21">Ditta was arrested later but denied using cocaine and and said he had been speaking to the suspected dealer because he was his client and argued their discussions were subject to "legal privilege."</seg>
<seg id="22">During his arrest Ditta picked up his wallet and tried to remove several credit cards but they were all seized and a hair sample was taken fom him.</seg>
<seg id="23">In a police interview he said he ran an office at his home address as well as work place and clients would call at his house on legal business.</seg>
<seg id="24">But the court heard he would call major players in the drugs supply chain, some of whom he had previously represented, after key arrests to tell them what detectives knew about them.</seg>
<seg id="25">Prosecuting, Anne Whyte said: "If anyone should know not to the break the law, it is a criminal solicitor."</seg>
<seg id="26">Mr Ditta is accused of abusing his position as a criminal solicitor, having become too involved with specific clients.</seg>
<seg id="27">The relationship we are talking about is not simply a drug dealer, but a drug dealer providing his own lawyer with drugs.</seg>
<seg id="28">Some of his communications will undoubtedly have been legitimate ones because he was their lawyer.</seg>
<seg id="29">But this went way beyond the ordinary confines of a lawyer-client relationship.</seg>
<seg id="30">He thwarted the police's investigation as much as possible to enable them to continue in their criminal activities.</seg>
<seg id="31">Mr Ditta was not honouring his profession, but dishonouring it.</seg>
<seg id="32">He got too close to certain clients, in particular Scarborough, and he allowed his independence to be compromised.</seg>
<seg id="33">Ditta denied wrongdoing and claimed: "If I was a corrupt lawyer, which I am not, and I wanted to feed information to Mr Scarborough, I would not wait 15 hours, I would do it immediately."</seg>
<seg id="34">But after the hearing Supt Lee Halstead from Lancashire Police said: "Mr Ditta turned from criminal solicitor to a criminal himself the moment he started obtaining drugs from organised criminals."</seg>
<seg id="35">His addiction to cocaine left him hopelessly compromised and vulnerable to the motives of leading members of organised crime groups who tasked him to obtain valuable information regarding police investigations.</seg>
<seg id="36">Solicitors should uphold the highest standards of integrity and should instil trust and confidence in the public.</seg>
<seg id="37">Mr Ditta has betrayed this trust and attempted to hide behind the veneer of his profession.</seg>
<seg id="38">Lancashire's Serious and Organised Crime Unit led the investigation into Mr Ditta which has also seen him convicted of three counts of possession of cocaine and now perverting the course of justice, demonstrating our commitment to bringing criminals to justice.</seg>
<seg id="39">Let this case serve as a warning to criminals that no one is beyond the reach of the law.</seg>
<seg id="40">We will find you and put you before the courts.</seg>
<seg id="41">Scarborough himself was jailed for 14 years after pleading guilty to conspiracy to supply heroin, cocaine and cannabis.</seg>
<seg id="42">Thirty five other men involved in the racket were jailed for a total of 153 years for drugs offences.</seg>
<seg id="43">On his website Ditta gave a question and answer session about himself in which he says his fantasy job would be a lawyer representing clients on Death Row in America, his ultimate dinner guest as being Mohammed Ali and inequality as his motivation for work.</seg>

<seg id="1">Kenyan press outraged at controversial media law</seg>
<seg id="2">"It is a frightening place, and it is valid to ask: what is there to prevent Parliament from simply sweeping away the independence of the judiciary tomorrow?" the paper said, challenging the bill as unconstitutional.</seg>
<seg id="3">"This law is draconian and very punitive and we reject it," said Cyrus Kamau, managing director for Capital Group - home to CapitalFM, one of Kenya's most respected independent radio stations and news websites.</seg>
<seg id="4">He said the new media tribunal "will always be biased because it's an extension of the government," and that restrictions on content and advertising would damage Kenya's place in the global economy.</seg>
<seg id="5">"I hope the president will listen to us, and we appeal to him to reject this bill and return it to the MPs," he said.</seg>
<seg id="6">According to The Star newspaper, the new bill will effectively hand the government "a stranglehold over the media," while The Standard said democracy and free speech in Kenya had been "dealt a major blow" and lambasted the bill as "draconian."</seg>
<seg id="7">The passing of the bill comes amid a string of measures to reinforce national security in the wake of the September's attack by Islamist gunmen on the Westgate shopping mall.</seg>
<seg id="8">Kenya media drew the ire of authorities by broadcasting security camera footage of troops who were dispatched to the scene of the attack purportedly robbing the upmarket mall.</seg>
<seg id="9">Police chief David Kimaiyo reacted by summoning two journalists and a media executive for questioning, although the summons was retracted following a media outcry.</seg>
<seg id="10">Under the new bill, media houses can be fined up to 20 million Kenyan shillings and individual journalists up to one million with the additional risk of being "de-listed," or barred from receiving official press accreditation.</seg>
<seg id="11">The tribunal also has the power to seize the property of an offender if a fine is not paid.</seg>
<seg id="12">According to the Daily Nation, "even one fine is enough to cripple most FM stations."</seg>
<seg id="13">It also said the measures could have a devastating effect on what it described as Kenya's "lively blogosphere."</seg>
<seg id="14">By silencing the media, politicians know they can do whatever they like with impunity.</seg>
<seg id="15">"No one will ever know," wrote Nation journalist Mutuma Mathiu, describing the Kenyan media as a key source of checks and balances in public life.</seg>
<seg id="16">"Left to themselves, politicians would bankrupt the country and take us back to hunting and gathering," he wrote.</seg>
<seg id="17">Kenyan lawmakers have been the target of public anger in the past.</seg>

<seg id="2">But most of them, do not know what is the interest</seg>
<seg id="3">More and more Czechs are putting money aside.</seg>
<seg id="4">Despite this, they will not reach the champion savings level in the region.</seg>
<seg id="5">The most money is put aside by Austrians who save on average 181 euros a month.</seg>
<seg id="6">People in Slovakia save a little more than the Czechs.</seg>
<seg id="7">This is according to a survey carried out by the Erste Group Savings Barometer in the countries of Central and Eastern Europe.</seg>
<seg id="8">It also showed that the mood of savers is improving and two thirds of those questioned plan to put more money aside.</seg>
<seg id="9">While Czechs are roughly in the middle of the table of savers, in Romania and Serbia people still use only very few savings products.</seg>
<seg id="10">For example, according to the survey every other Serb saves money at home "under the pillow."</seg>
<seg id="11">In this country the number of people who save a higher amount each month has risen this year,.</seg>
<seg id="12">Only last year 26 per cent of respondents put aside between 1,000 and 2,500 crowns each month in various types of saving accounts,; this year it is 5 per cent more.</seg>
<seg id="13">However the average monthly deposit in the year-on-year comparison fell slightly to 2078 crowns.</seg>
<seg id="14">The biggest hit amongst saving products is the pension plan.</seg>
<seg id="15">Some 54 per cent of Czechs prefer this, whereas three years ago it was the favourite method for the appreciation of savings for only 36 per cent of people.</seg>
<seg id="16">In contrast, the  popularity of the building savings is decreasing in popularity and compared with last year the interest in investment funds has also fallen significantly.</seg>
<seg id="17">These are now used by only 16 per cent of respondents, whereas last year it was almost a quarter of people.</seg>
<seg id="18">The survey also showed that although people consider saving money to be important, the majority of them do not know what the yield is on individual products.</seg>
<seg id="19">Primarily young people up to the age of 30 do not know what interest is paid on their money.</seg>
<seg id="20">In contrast, the best knowledge of the yield on the money they save has the group of older  respondents – 76 per cent of respondents aged over 50 know that.</seg>

<seg id="1">Mozambique security concerns mount as powerful personalities clash</seg>
<seg id="2">With a statue of Samora Machel, Mozambique's founding president, staring down on them, thousands of people gathered in central Maputo to chant peace slogans in a rare public demonstration.</seg>
<seg id="3">"We want peace back; we want stability," said Vanessa de Sousa, chief executive of an investment company.</seg>
<seg id="4">Fearful about the future of her country, she swapped her corporate attire for a T-shirt emblazoned with "we demand security" in Portuguese as she joined the crowds in the capital's Independence Square on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="5">For two weeks, there have been almost daily reports of clashes between government forces and Renamo, some of the worst skirmishes since a peace deal more than 20 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="6">Renamo was once a notorious rebel movement, initially backed by white-ruled Rhodesia and then South Africa's apartheid government as part of efforts to destabilise the country's independent government.</seg>
<seg id="7">After a 1992 peace deal, it became an opposition party.</seg>
<seg id="8">Analysts believe the country is unlikely to slide back into full-blown conflict, but recent events have unnerved foreign investors and locals.</seg>
<seg id="9">The stakes are high for the fast-growing economy as the discovery of huge offshore gas reserves and coal deposits in the northwest could bring in more than $50bn of investment over the next few next years from companies including Rio Tinto, Vale of Brazil, Eni of Italy and Anadarko of the US.</seg>
<seg id="10">The ruling Frelimo party, the dominant political force since 1975, and Renamo blame each other for the tension.</seg>
<seg id="11">Renamo says the government initiated the latest clashes by launching an attack on its members in Sofala province, traditionally a Renamo stronghold, on October 17.</seg>
<seg id="12">Assaults on the former rebels then escalated as government forces attacked Renamo bases and attempted to kill Afonso Dhlakama, the group's leader, Fernando Mazanga, Renamo's spokesman, told the Financial Times.</seg>
<seg id="13">The government blames Renamo for triggering the clashes, accusing it of attacking soldiers.</seg>
<seg id="14">President Armando Guebuza has sought to play down concerns about instability.</seg>
<seg id="15">Mr Guebuza told AFP, the French news agency, on Wednesday that Mr Dhlakama saw himself as a "loser" who wanted to use "whatever remains of his forces to try to prove that he can impose on the government his own decisions."</seg>
<seg id="16">Both Frelimo and Renamo insist they want to avoid war.</seg>
<seg id="17">But concerns have grown after Mr Mazanga was quoted as saying Renamo was abandoning the 1992 peace accord.</seg>
<seg id="18">He told the FT that he meant the agreement was no longer being respected by Frelimo.</seg>
<seg id="19">"Our vision is to come back to negotiations, but with seriousness," Mr Mazanga said.</seg>
<seg id="20">Previous talks between the parties have done little to ease tensions fuelled by a series of clashes this year.</seg>
<seg id="21">"It's two big men (Guebuza and Dhlakama) butting heads together," said Joseph Hanlon, a lecturer at the Open University and Mozambique expert.</seg>
<seg id="22">Neither of them are good negotiators and neither of them are prepared to make the kind of concessions that are necessary.</seg>
<seg id="23">Renamo, which has been pushing for electoral reforms, had already said that it would boycott municipal elections due in November.</seg>
<seg id="24">Presidential and parliamentary polls are scheduled for next year.</seg>
<seg id="25">Some commentators have interpreted its use of force as the attempt of an ailing movement to win concessions and financial spoils from the government.</seg>
<seg id="26">Renamo's share of the vote has been declining since 1992, while a newer party, the Democratic Movement of Mozambique (MDM) which was formed by a former Renamo member, is expected to improve its showing at the elections.</seg>
<seg id="27">Mr Mazanga says Mr Guebuza - who is due to step down when his second term ends next year - wants to destroy the country's democracy.</seg>
<seg id="28">"He does not want multi-party democracy, he does not want transparent elections he does not want peace because he does not want to leave the presidency," Mr Mazanga said.</seg>
<seg id="29">It is unclear how much capacity Renamo has, but it has carried out disruptive hit-and-run attacks on police stations and vehicles on a key north-south highway.</seg>
<seg id="30">Most of the skirmishes have taken place in Sofala province, which is several hundred kilometres north of Maputo, but hosts Beira, the port that miners, including Rio Tinto and Vale, rely on to export coal.</seg>
<seg id="31">In June, Rio suspended its use of the railway for about a week after Renamo threatened to attack the line.</seg>
<seg id="32">Mr Mazanga was coy when asked about whether Renamo would repeat this threat.</seg>
<seg id="33">Renamo wanted to "warn the international community that things were not going well in Mozambique," Mr Mazanga said.</seg>
<seg id="34">The instability has added to frustrations with the government, says Fernando Lima, head of Mediacoop, an independent media company, with many people also concerned about corruption, the slow pace of development and a recent spate of kidnappings.</seg>
<seg id="35">"People think the ones responsible for the future of the country are the government and the president, and he should be the one to find solutions for the problems," he says.</seg>
<seg id="36">Omar Sultuane, a demonstrator, said people just wanted stability.</seg>
<seg id="37">"No one cares about Renamo and Frelimo, they just want peace again, they want free access to the roads," he said.</seg>

<seg id="1">Brno Observatory will take visitors into space in a new digitarium</seg>
<seg id="2">At first glance it is clear that the hall of the large planetarium has changed in the last six months.</seg>
<seg id="3">There is a new stage, visitors can sink into the new, comfortable seats and above their heads a projection area 17 metres in diameter has been added in the shape of a dome by the American company Spitz.</seg>
<seg id="4">In the middle  of the hall is the most important part, the new projector from Japan.</seg>
<seg id="5">For perfect image, further smaller projectors are scattered about the hall.</seg>
<seg id="6">Another important part of the whole facility is hidden behind the walls of the hall.</seg>
<seg id="7">"There are twenty-one computers which generate image," said the director of the Brno Observatory, Jiří Dušek.</seg>
<seg id="8">The computers ensure the image from several projectors does not overlap but gives a coherent impression.</seg>
<seg id="9">"The computers are thirty to forty times more powerful than the classic PCs," said Tomáš Hladík, the observatory technician.</seg>
<seg id="10">The digitarium can conjure up an extremely realistic and three-dimensional model of the night sky, the human body or the bottom of the ocean.</seg>
<seg id="11">Viewers therefore feel to be right in the middle of space or a human brain.</seg>
<seg id="12">The nearest similar facility is in Warsaw and Hamburg.</seg>
<seg id="13">The observatory management plans to screen programmes it has bought and  also its own work.</seg>
<seg id="14">From Saturday, there are two shows on the programme.</seg>
<seg id="15">The first is called Astronaut and is aimed at adults.</seg>
<seg id="16">People will learn about training of cosmonauts, fly to space, spin on a centrifuge, and then see graphic examples of the challenging conditions that astronauts face in space.</seg>
<seg id="17">The second programme is for children and is called Kaluoka’hina – The Enchanted Reef.</seg>
<seg id="18">It tells the story of a reef whose brightly coloured inhabitants lived a quiet life until a nearby volcano exploded.</seg>
<seg id="19">The whole digitarium cost around fifty million crowns, which was mostly paid for by the Ministry of Education.</seg>
<seg id="20">Smaller amounts were contributed by the City of Brno and the observatory from their budget.</seg>
<seg id="21">The projection area cost ten million crowns and the projector twelve million.</seg>
<seg id="22">The rest was swallowed up by the audio visual equipment and the computers," explains Dušek.</seg>
<seg id="23">The installation of the digitarium followed the reconstruction of the whole building, which the observatory underwent two years ago.</seg>
<seg id="24">According to the director Dušek, 25,000 to 30,000 visitors could come by the end of the year.</seg>

<seg id="1">We have studied 11,000 ADS!</seg>
<seg id="2">We know where they want you to work!</seg>
<seg id="3">In November last year, analysis captured over 11,000 ads offering jobs, of which 4,300 were published in newspapers and 6,800 (62 per cent) were on the internet.</seg>
<seg id="4">The internet is thus becoming one of the most important media for publishing job offers.</seg>
<seg id="5">Back in 2005, when the survey was conducted for the first time, it had a share of 26 per cent.</seg>
<seg id="6">In the last two surveys (2007 and 2010), it stabilised at around 60 per cent.</seg>
<seg id="7">The advertising of job offers in itself according to the analysis reflects the current situation on the labour market to a considerable extent.</seg>
<seg id="8">An example might be the simple comparison of the number of ads published in a period of economic prosperity and in a period of economic crisis.</seg>
<seg id="9">For instance, in 2007, in the same period monitored, almost 25,900 ads were published; in 2012, it was less than half.</seg>
<seg id="10">Job offers on the internet are aimed at a narrower, notably more qualified group of professions.</seg>
<seg id="11">In comparison, job offers in the newspapers cover a broader spectrum of jobs, including blue collar ones, said the author of the analysis, Pavlína Šťastnová.</seg>
<seg id="12">The level of representation for selected professional groups is varied in both media.</seg>
<seg id="13">On the internet, the leading positions were taken by ads looking for managers and executives, sales representatives, programmers and financial experts.</seg>
<seg id="14">The positions of programmers and managers of small businesses only appeared on the internet.</seg>
<seg id="15">In newspapers, the share of these professional jobs was significantly lower; in contrast high representation includes service and blue collar jobs in particular.</seg>
<seg id="16">Among the most frequently mentioned requirements the employers expressed via their ads is, of course, education.</seg>
<seg id="17">Other areas covered included knowledge of foreign languages, in particular English.</seg>
<seg id="18">In newspapers, the requirement for knowledge of a foreign language was given in three per cent of ads, on the internet it was 37 per cent.</seg>
<seg id="19">Only in two per cent of ads did employers request an active knowledge of two foreign languages.</seg>
<seg id="20">Demands for "computer literacy" appeared in 40 per cent of ads (in the newspapers in 11 per cent, on the internet in 57 per cent).</seg>
<seg id="21">Experience in the industry was required in 54 per cent of ads.</seg>
<seg id="22">Requirements for experience are largely linked to the qualified professions.</seg>
<seg id="23">They refer particularly to production managers and other executives.</seg>
<seg id="24">In blue-collar professions, it refers in particular to mechanics and repair jobs or manufacturers and processors of food products and people who repair electronics, added the author of the study Jiří Tillner.</seg>
<seg id="25">In half of their ads, employers also list requirements for qualities and skills of potential applicants.</seg>
<seg id="26">Communication skills have long appeared in first place as the most commonly required skills in ads.</seg>
<seg id="27">Employers also require flexibility, adaptability and dynamism, independence, responsibility, organisational skills and reliability.</seg>

<seg id="1">Ben Greenman: The Tenth Anniversary of the New York Comedy Festival: The New Yorker</seg>
<seg id="2">One could argue that New York City is the birthplace of standup comedy in America: nearly a hundred years ago, the vaudevillian Frank Fay, who served as the master of ceremonies at the Palace Theatre, on Broadway, started telling jokes directly to the crowd, in a conversational manner.</seg>
<seg id="3">Fay's innovation has been extended through the years, most recently by the New York Comedy Festival.</seg>
<seg id="4">Created and overseen by Caroline Hirsch, the founder of the standup institution Carolines, the festival celebrates its tenth anniversary this year, with more than sixty shows at small clubs and large theatres.</seg>
<seg id="5">"Most of these headliners appeared at Carolines, and went on to greater success, to the point where they're too big to play a club," Hirsch said.</seg>
<seg id="6">We built this festival as a way of continuing to work with them.</seg>
<seg id="7">This year's event includes appearances by Wanda Sykes, Kathy Griffin, and Bill Maher, as well as "Stand Up for Heroes," an annual music-and-comedy benefit for military veterans, at Madison Square Garden, featuring, among others, Bruce Springsteen, Jon Stewart, Roger Waters, and Bill Cosby.</seg>
<seg id="8">As the festival has expanded, so has the world of comedy.</seg>
<seg id="9">Several of the comedians participating in this year's festival came up through nontraditional channels, such as shows on smaller networks, like Comedy Central, FX, and Spike.</seg>
<seg id="10">Nick Kroll rose to prominence on a deep-cable sitcom (FXX's gleefully raunchy fantasy-football-themed "The League") and now has his own Comedy Central sketch show.</seg>
<seg id="11">Jenny Slate has been a cast member on both "Saturday Night Live" and "Parks and Recreation," though she is best known for her viral video series "Marcel the Shell with Shoes On."</seg>
<seg id="12">Both Kroll and Slate, as well as other young comedians with distinctive voices (the surreally pessimistic Anthony Jeselnik, the wry, racially focussed W. Kamau Bell), are products of the decentralized world of American comedy.</seg>
<seg id="13">One of the festival's biggest draws will be an interview: David Steinberg talking to Larry David.</seg>
<seg id="14">Steinberg started as a standup comedian but has become an accomplished television and film director, as well as an unofficial comedy historian.</seg>
<seg id="15">From 2005 to 2007, he hosted a show on TV Land called "Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg."</seg>
<seg id="16">The meeting takes place at Town Hall, in the center of Manhattan.</seg>
<seg id="17">"The city is definitely in the comedy DNA of all of Larry's work," Steinberg said.</seg>
<seg id="18">He was telling me that, when he's here, sometimes he'll walk down an alley between two buildings and think to himself, Hey, if I lose all my money, maybe I'll live here.</seg>

<seg id="4">Any other solution will reduce the level of political culture, which is already so negligible.</seg>

<seg id="2">A federal appeals court on Thursday blocked a judge's order requiring changes to the New York Police Department's stop-and-frisk program and removed the judge from the case.</seg>
<seg id="3">The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said the decisions of Judge Shira Scheindlin will be stayed pending the outcome of an appeal by the city.</seg>
<seg id="4">The judge had ruled in August the city violated the Constitution in the way it carried out its program of stopping and questioning people.</seg>
<seg id="5">The city appealed her findings and her remedial orders, including a decision to assign a monitor to help the police department changes its policy and training program associated with it.</seg>
<seg id="6">The appeals court heard arguments Tuesday on the requested stay.</seg>
<seg id="7">The appeals court said the judge needed to be removed from the case because she ran afoul of the code of conduct for U.S. judges by compromising the necessity for a judge to avoid the appearance of partiality in part because of a series of media interviews and public statements responding publicly to criticism of the court.</seg>
<seg id="8">The judge had ruled that police officers violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people by wrongly targeting black and Hispanic men with its stop-and-frisk program.</seg>
<seg id="9">She appointed an outside monitor to oversee major changes, including reforms in policies, training and supervision, and she ordered a pilot program to test body-worn cameras in some precincts where most stops occur.</seg>
<seg id="10">In August, New York City agreed to end the practice of storing the names and addresses of people whose cases are dismissed after a police stop.</seg>
<seg id="11">An oral argument on the city's appeal is scheduled for sometime after March 14, 2014.</seg>
<seg id="12">The stop-and-frisk tactic has been criticized by a number of civil rights advocates.</seg>
<seg id="13">Stop-and-frisk has been around for decades in some form, but recorded stops increased dramatically under the administration of independent Mayor Michael Bloomberg to an all-time high in 2011 of 684,330, mostly of black and Hispanic men.</seg>
<seg id="14">A lawsuit was filed in 2004 by four men, all minorities, and became a class action case.</seg>
<seg id="15">Supporters of changes to the NYPD's stop-and-frisk program say the changes will end unfair practices, will mold a more trusted and effective police force and can affect how other police departments use the policy.</seg>
<seg id="16">Opponents say the changes would lower police morale but not crime, waste money and not solve a broader problem of a police force under pressure after shrinking by thousands of officers during the last decade.</seg>
<seg id="17">The judge noted she wasn't putting an end to the stop-and-frisk practice, which is constitutional, but was reforming the way the NYPD implemented its stops.</seg>

<seg id="1">One fifth of shopping centres face low visitor numbers</seg>
<seg id="2">This is according to data from real estate consultancy firms Cushman & Wakefield and Jones Lang LaSalle.</seg>
<seg id="3">In the Bohnice area of Prague, the Krakov Shopping Centre is opening to the public; it will be Prague’s 19th shopping centre.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Czech Republic now has a total of 90 large shopping centres.</seg>
<seg id="5">The unsatisfactory performance concerns about 20 per cent of medium-sized and large centres.</seg>
<seg id="6">The main problems are inadequately large centres for the location and poor layouts, meaning too many floors or complicated and confusing organisation of passages, or dead spots in the centres," said Michal Soták from Cushman & Wakefield.</seg>
<seg id="7">Also, according to Sylvie Samadi, the head of the retail property department at Jones Lang LaSalle, about one fifth of shopping centres are struggling with low visitor numbers.</seg>
<seg id="8">The main reasons include poor accessibility, the low income category of local inhabitants, or an over saturated local market.</seg>
<seg id="9">Some projects opened almost fully occupied, but their results were mainly unsatisfactory at first.</seg>
<seg id="10">Customers today are somewhat conservative and do not like to change their shopping habits.</seg>
<seg id="11">New shopping centres must try harder to "attract" their customers to new brands on the market, leisure, services and marketing events," added Samadi.</seg>
<seg id="12">The occupancy of shopping centres is stable in general, according to Soták, and in some centres it is even rising, because landlords were willing to reduce rental prices during the crisis and let out some units.</seg>
<seg id="13">"It’s true though that recently they have opened some projects which are not fully occupied and the average occupancy level is lower (for example, Breda & Weinstein in Opava, or Šantovka in Olomouc)," added Soták.</seg>
<seg id="14">Shopping centres opened in the last two years are gaining market ground very slowly, according to Sylvie Samadi.</seg>
<seg id="15">However, there is place on the market for new projects.</seg>
<seg id="16">The number of places suitable for building a successful project is very limited.</seg>
<seg id="17">For instance, in Prague we see a space for the construction of a project which could serve residents of Prague 6.</seg>
<seg id="18">There is definitely a room on the market to build smaller, local projects, so-called "convenience centres", focused on shopping and services for everyday needs for people living in the immediate vicinity," said Samadi.</seg>
<seg id="19">Soták also says there is room for more shopping centres in the domestic market.</seg>
<seg id="20">And that is for both small "service" centres and for large projects in Prague, or medium-sized projects, or expansions in regional cities.</seg>
<seg id="21">"Towns and cities like Kladno, České Budějovice, Brno and Plzeň have room for further growth," added Soták.</seg>
<seg id="22">In Prague, he sees a space for a planned shopping centre at Vítězné Náměstí, and Na Příkopě Street and Wenceslas Square also have clear potential.</seg>
<seg id="23">"The expansions of retail parks are developing intensively, allowing traders to cover and expand to smaller and smaller towns for reasonable rent and operating costs; there is also room in some locations for smaller local or neighbourhood shopping centres, or their reconstruction, such as, for instance, the reconstruction of the Prior shopping centres, which benefit from a good location," added Dita Kubánková from the company DTZ.</seg>
<seg id="24">In the Czech Republic there are currently 90 modern shopping centres with a total of over 2.2 million square metres of gross leasable area.</seg>
<seg id="25">A quarter of all these shopping centres are in Prague.</seg>
<seg id="26">Among the 20 biggest shopping centres by number of tenants, there are nine in Prague, according to data from Incoma GfK.</seg>
<seg id="27">The Czech Republic is below the EU average for the number of shopping parks; in comparison with values in Britain and France, the Czech Republic is lagging behind by about 50 square metres per thousand inhabitants.</seg>

<seg id="1">Coulson used phone hacking to verify tip</seg>
<seg id="2">Former News of the World editor Andy Coulson allegedly used "phone hacking, surveillance and confrontation" in an attempt to confirm a bogus tip about an affair involving then-home secretary Charles Clarke.</seg>
<seg id="3">Prosecutor Andrew Edis QC told the Old Bailey that the News of the World heard a false rumour in May 2005 that Clarke was seeing his "attractive special adviser," Hannah Pawlby.</seg>
<seg id="4">The newspaper tasked private investigator Glenn Mulcaire with hacking Pawlby's voicemails and "door-stepped" her, but Coulson also called and left her voicemails, the court heard.</seg>
<seg id="5">"The prosecution suggests that Mr Coulson, who is now the editor of the NotW, he is not the man who stands outside people's houses hoping to catch them out, he is the man who likes to put the story to people to see what they will say," Mr Edis said.</seg>
<seg id="6">He said the NotW used three ways to investigate stories: phone hacking, surveillance, and confrontation.</seg>
<seg id="7">The editor is personally involved in the third.</seg>
<seg id="8">Obviously he knows about the second, surveillance, he must do.</seg>
<seg id="9">What about the first?</seg>
<seg id="10">Does he know about phone hacking?</seg>
<seg id="11">He says he doesn't, we say "Oh yes, he did".</seg>
<seg id="12">Rumours about an affair involving Clarke were first picked up by the NotW's features desk when a source who was sexually interested in Ms Pawlby was told: "Don't bother wasting your time, she's with Charles."</seg>
<seg id="13">A tape of voicemails taken from her phone on at least three occasions was seized from Mulcaire's home in August 2006.</seg>
<seg id="14">Investigators also found entries on the private investigator's computer which had Ms Pawlby and her sister as "Projects."</seg>
<seg id="15">During the period she was being investigated, Ms Pawlby's grandparents received anonymous calls asking for information about her, Mr Edis said.</seg>
<seg id="16">Meanwhile, former chief reporter Neville Thurlbeck and former reporter James Weatherup oversaw surveillance of Ms Pawlby's movements.</seg>
<seg id="17">Leaving her a voicemail on June 18 2005, Coulson told her: "I've got a story that we're planning to run tomorrow that I really would like to speak to Charles about."</seg>

<seg id="1">NSA revelations boost corporate paranoia about state surveillance</seg>
<seg id="2">On a mild day in late August a German police helicopter buzzed low over the US consulate in Frankfurt, the financial capital of Germany.</seg>
<seg id="3">On the instruction of the Office for the Protection of the Constitution (BfV), Germany's domestic intelligence agency, its mission was to photograph the rooftop of the US outpost, which is located less than 5km from the European Central Bank and Bundesbank.</seg>
<seg id="4">German media say the BfV hoped to identify the presence of listening antennas and the action prompted an exchange between the US and the German foreign ministry in Berlin.</seg>
<seg id="5">James Clapper, US Director of National Intelligence, insisted again in September that the US does not use foreign intelligence capabilities "to steal the trade secrets of foreign companies on behalf of US companies to enhance their international competitiveness or increase their bottom line."</seg>
<seg id="6">But ever since Edward Snowden, the contractor turned whistleblower, began releasing his treasure trove of US surveillance secrets, European governments and business leaders are no longer sure whether to take the director at his word.</seg>
<seg id="7">Reports that the US National Security Agency spied on Brazilian oil company Petrobras and gained access to data held by US cloud providers including Google and Yahoo have ratcheted corporate paranoia about state surveillance to new highs.</seg>
<seg id="8">The final straw came when it was revealed that Chancellor Angela Merkel's phone had been bugged, possibly for about a decade.</seg>
<seg id="9">If Europe's most powerful person can be targeted, then surely business leaders are also potential targets.</seg>
<seg id="10">Snowden has made transparent the intensive collaboration between US intelligence services and companies.</seg>
<seg id="11">I think it's conceivable that these data are used for mutual benefit.</seg>
<seg id="12">"Germany must wake up," says Oliver Grün, president of BITMi, which represents small and medium sized German IT companies.</seg>
<seg id="13">German companies believe the US now poses almost as big a risk as China when it comes to industrial espionage and data theft, according to a survey published in July by EY, the consultancy.</seg>
<seg id="14">In all the documentation leaked by Mr Snowden, there has, however, been no evidence to date that the US has passed on foreign companies' trade secrets to its own companies.</seg>
<seg id="15">Politicians have expressed concern that the EU lacks certain IT and internet capabilities and should strive to reduce its dependence on the US.</seg>
<seg id="16">Business leaders are sceptical about this.</seg>
<seg id="17">Someone in the German parliament says we should build a German Google.</seg>
<seg id="18">I can only shut my eyes and slowly open them again...</seg>
<seg id="19">"That's not the way," Hasso Plattner, chairman of German business software company SAP, says.</seg>
<seg id="20">If one wanted a strong European IT industry, then one shouldn't have let it die out 20 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="21">Everything is subsidised in Germany, from coal, to cars and farmers.</seg>
<seg id="22">Everything but the IT industry.</seg>
<seg id="23">Still, the reach and technical sophistication of US spy agencies exposed by the Snowden revelations have come as a shock to some companies who previously thought the biggest surveillance risk was posed by China.</seg>
<seg id="24">A big shift is occurring in cloud computing where European executives have become more aware that data stored in the US is subject to that jurisdiction and therefore potentially vulnerable.</seg>
<seg id="25">According to a survey carried out by the Cloud Security Alliance, a trade body, some 10 per cent of non-US members cancelled plans to use a US-based cloud provider after revelations about the US Prism data mining programme.</seg>
<seg id="26">Jim Snabe, co-chief executive at SAP, says: "We see a new question from customers that didn't come up a year ago - which is where is my data stored and can you guarantee that it stays physically in that jurisdiction."</seg>
<seg id="27">Many German executives argue that the latest reports are simply confirmation of what they already knew: that powerful states want to steal their most prized secrets and these data must therefore be guarded at all costs.</seg>
<seg id="28">That economic spying takes place is not a surprise.</seg>
<seg id="29">It has always taken place.</seg>
<seg id="30">"This has been a topic for many years and hasn't fundamentally changed through the current discussion," says Kurt Bock, chief executive of chemical maker BASF.</seg>
<seg id="31">The Americans spy on us on the commercial and industrial level as we spy on them too, because it is in the national interest to defend our businesses.</seg>
<seg id="32">Corporate leaders are not generally keen to boast about the countermeasures they have taken, in case this hands an advantage to an attacker.</seg>
<seg id="33">For large companies, the message has long since been drummed home that picking up a free USB stick at a trade fair, or leaving a laptop unguarded in a hotel room are unwise, to say the least.</seg>
<seg id="34">Ulrich Hackenberg, board member at carmaker Audi, says it has been standard practice for years for mobile phones to be collected before board meetings so they cannot be used as remote listening devices.</seg>
<seg id="35">Germany's BfV advises executives to consider using simple prepaid mobiles when on foreign trips because of the risk that smart phones are compromised.</seg>
<seg id="36">The prepaid mobiles are then thrown away afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="37">However, there is concern that small and medium-sized companies remain vulnerable to hacking and surveillance.</seg>
<seg id="38">In Germany, many of these companies are global market leaders in their particular niche.</seg>
<seg id="39">"Small and medium sized companies often lack the experience, personnel and financial resources to protect corporate secrets effectively against unauthorised access," the BfV warns in a report.</seg>
<seg id="40">The US warns its own companies about economic espionage by other countries.</seg>
<seg id="41">The US National Intelligence Estimate in February named France alongside Russia and Israel in a second tier of offenders who engage in hacking for economic intelligence, behind China, according to The Washington Post.</seg>
<seg id="42">A board member at a German blue-chip company concurred that when it comes to economic espionage, "the French are the worst."</seg>
<seg id="43">Bernard Squarcini, former head of the French internal intelligence agency DCRI, was quoted in an interview this month as saying: "The services know perfectly well that all countries, even as they co-operate in the antiterrorist fight, spy on their allies."</seg>

<seg id="2">The parents of a Georgia teenager, whose body was found inside a rolled-up wrestling mat in his high school gym, believe their son was murdered, the family's attorney said Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="3">Kendrick Johnson, of Valdosta, Ga., was found Jan. 11 stuck in an upright mat propped behind the bleachers inside his high school gym.</seg>
<seg id="4">Lowndes County sheriff's investigators concluded Johnson died in a freak accident, but the 17-year-old's family disputes that.</seg>
<seg id="5">"They absolutely think their son was murdered," Benjamin Crump, an attorney representing Kenneth and Jacquelyn Johnson, told FoxNews.com.</seg>
<seg id="6">They never believed he died the way the sheriff concluded.</seg>
<seg id="7">"They believe that it defies logic, the laws of physics as well as common sense," Crump said.</seg>
<seg id="8">They think this is a cover-up to protect the person or people responsible for their son's death.</seg>
<seg id="9">"They sent their son to school with a book-bag and he was returned to them in a body bag," he said.</seg>
<seg id="10">U.S. Attorney Michael Moore said Thursday he is conducting a formal investigation into Johnson's death, noting that several key questions remain unanswered.</seg>
<seg id="11">What was the cause of death?</seg>
<seg id="12">Was his death the result of a crime?</seg>
<seg id="13">Moore said at a press conference Thursday afternoon.</seg>
<seg id="14">I will follow the facts wherever they lead.</seg>
<seg id="15">My objective is to discovery the truth.</seg>
<seg id="16">"I am of the opinion that a sufficient basis exists" for a formal investigation, he said.</seg>
<seg id="17">Moore told reporters that the initial autopsy indicated Johnson died as a result of "positional asphyxia."</seg>
<seg id="18">A second autopsy, however, listed a different cause of death, according to Moore.</seg>
<seg id="19">"There are several questions that must be answered or confirmed," he said.</seg>
<seg id="20">Moore added that if he uncovers sufficient evidence to warrant a criminal or civil rights investigation into the death of Johnson he will ask the FBI to conduct it.</seg>
<seg id="21">A representative from the Lowndes County Sheriff's Office was not immediately available for comment when contacted Thursday.</seg>

<seg id="2">On Wednesday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released a set of guidelines to manage children's food allergies at school.</seg>
<seg id="3">This is the first set of such guidelines the U.S. government has put out, as the number of school-age children suffering from food allergies climbs.</seg>
<seg id="4">One in 20 children in the United States now have food allergies.</seg>
<seg id="5">The CDC found the prevalence of food allergies among children increased 18 percent between 1997 and 2007.</seg>
<seg id="6">The guide contains information for schools on how to make faculty and staff aware of children's food allergies, and how to handle them should an allergic reaction occur.</seg>
<seg id="7">It also recommends schools have epinephrine stocked -- the EpiPen brand auto-injector being most commonly used -- to respond to potentially fatal anaphylaxis.</seg>
<seg id="8">State legislatures have recently been updating rules to allow schools to stock epinephrine more easily.</seg>
<seg id="9">The report also includes a list of typical symptoms communicated by children who are having an allergic reaction.</seg>
<seg id="10">Kids may say, "It feels like something is poking my tongue," "My tongue feels like there is hair on it," or "My tongue is tingling."</seg>

<seg id="1">Parents of Intersex Kids Can Pick 'Gender Undetermined'</seg>
<seg id="2">Germany became the first European nation to recognize a third gender for babies born with ambiguous genitalia.</seg>
<seg id="3">No longer will newborns be rigidly assigned to male or female.</seg>
<seg id="4">The new law doesn't require parents to declare any gender for such children, allowing parents to declare gender "undetermined" or "unspecified" on their birth certificates.</seg>
<seg id="5">The aim of the law was to take the pressure off parents who might make hasty decisions on sex-assignment surgery for newborns, and to fight discrimination against those who are intersex.</seg>
<seg id="6">One intersex person, according to the BBC, said years later, "I am neither a man nor a woman."</seg>
<seg id="7">I will remain the patchwork created by doctors, bruised and scarred.</seg>
<seg id="8">An estimated one in 2,000 children born each year is neither boy nor girl.</seg>
<seg id="9">They are intersex, part of a group of about 60 conditions that fall under the diagnosis of disorders of sexual development, an umbrella term for those with atypical chromosomes, gonads (ovaries or testes), or unusually developed genitalia.</seg>
<seg id="10">Wallis Simpson may have been intersex.</seg>
<seg id="11">Gender identification is still not well understood, but most experts in the United States say that when sex cannot be determined, it's better to use the best available information to assign it then to wait and monitor the child's psychological and physical development before undertaking surgery, if at all.</seg>
<seg id="12">New York City psychiatrist Dr. Jack Drescher, who specializes in issues of gender identification, said the new German law "sounds like a good thing."</seg>
<seg id="13">Intersex children pose ethical dilemma.</seg>
<seg id="14">"Some people have life-endangering conditions that require surgery, but most kids do not," he said.</seg>
<seg id="15">You can make a gender assignment without surgery, and then see how identity develops.</seg>
<seg id="16">The science of knowing how a child will develop any gender identity is not very accurate.</seg>
<seg id="17">Nobody can answer the questions about why this happens.</seg>
<seg id="18">It's like the mystery of why people are gay.</seg>
<seg id="19">A report filed to the European Commission in 2011 described intersex people as different from transsexual or transgender people, as their status is not gender related but instead relates to their biological makeup, which is neither exclusively male nor exclusively female, but is typical of both at once or not clearly defined as either.</seg>
<seg id="20">These features can manifest themselves in secondary sexual characteristics, such as muscle mass, hair distribution, breasts and stature; primary sexual characteristics such as reproductive organs and genitalia; or in chromosomal structures and hormones.</seg>
<seg id="21">The report also gives an overview of the discrimination faced by intersex and transgender people in the realm of employment, as well as levels of harassment, violence and bias crimes.</seg>
<seg id="22">Gender nonconforming boys now have special camp.</seg>
<seg id="23">Already, Australia and Nepal allow adults to mark male, female or a "third gender" on their official documents.</seg>
<seg id="24">In June, a 52-year-old Australian, Norrie May-Welby, became the world's first recognized "genderless" person after winning a legal appeal to keep an "unspecified" gender status for life.</seg>
<seg id="25">German passports will have a third designation other than M or F -- X, for intersex, according to the Interior Ministry.</seg>
<seg id="26">In neighboring France, gender issues are still controversial, according to a news report on France 24.</seg>
<seg id="27">In 2011, dozens of French lawmakers from that strongly Catholic country signed a petition for "gender theory" to be withdrawn from school textbooks.</seg>
<seg id="28">The U.S. website Catholic Online has also opposed the German law, writing that "as the world is being dragged into a new state, where gender is a choice, but sexual activity is not, we reverse two more pillars of civilization."</seg>
<seg id="29">One Maryland mother of a newborn also told the Baby Zone that she would rather see babies assigned gender at birth.</seg>
<seg id="30">"Parenting is stressful enough without extra limitations, especially if you don't know the gender of your child," she told the parenting website.</seg>
<seg id="31">Children need stability and certainty.</seg>
<seg id="32">Historically, children born with both male and female genitalia were called hermaphrodites, named for the handsome Greek god who had dual sexuality.</seg>
<seg id="33">And as little as a decade ago, the medical community thought of gender as a slate that could be erased and then redrawn.</seg>
<seg id="34">But now, many are challenging the ethical basis of surgery, knowing that gender identity is complex, and doctors can sometimes get it wrong, not knowing how a child will feel about their gender assignment when they grow up.</seg>
<seg id="35">"Back in the middle of the 20th century, it was called a 'psychiatric emergency,'" said Drescher.</seg>
<seg id="36">When these kids were born, you didn't call the psychiatrist, you called a surgeon.</seg>
<seg id="37">The prevailing theory on how to treat children with ambiguous genitalia was put forward by Dr. John Money at Johns Hopkins University, who held that gender was malleable.</seg>
<seg id="38">He coined the term "gender identity" and argued that social and environmental cues -- how parents raised a child -- interacted with a child's genes and hormones to shape whether the person identified as male or female.</seg>
<seg id="39">But in one 1966 case, known as "John/Joan," his theories became controversial.</seg>
<seg id="40">He advised the parents of a boy whose penis had been severed in a botched circumcision to have the child fully castrated, removing his testicles, as well, and to raise him as a girl.</seg>
<seg id="41">"Money presented the case as a successful case of transition, but it was not," said Drescher.</seg>
<seg id="42">When the boy was around 15, he transitioned back to a boy and married a woman.</seg>
<seg id="43">But at 38, he committed suicide.</seg>
<seg id="44">Drescher said that now some doctors are still "practicing that model."</seg>
<seg id="45">But in the 1990s, with the advent of the Internet, survivors of these gender surgeries have come forward "not happy with the outcome."</seg>
<seg id="46">Such was the case with Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old writer from Montana, who was born with XY male chromosomes but ambiguous genitals.</seg>
<seg id="47">Doctors couldn't be sure if he had a large clitoris or a small penis and were convinced he could never live a "satisfactory life" as a man.</seg>
<seg id="48">So shortly after his birth in 1976, Bruce's external organ and testes were surgically removed and he was raised as a girl.</seg>
<seg id="49">He was given female hormones at age 12.</seg>
<seg id="50">"I knew that I wasn't a girl," he told ABCNews.com.</seg>
<seg id="51">I was unhappy, but it was really difficult to ask questions.</seg>
<seg id="52">At 18, he was set for a vaginoplasty.</seg>
<seg id="53">But depressed and knowing something was wrong, he demanded medical records.</seg>
<seg id="54">What he found out was horrifying.</seg>
<seg id="55">I was sterilized at birth -- and no one ever told me.</seg>
<seg id="56">Bruce was born with a DSD that prevented his body from producing enough testosterone to properly develop his genitals.</seg>
<seg id="57">After learning the truth, he changed back to a man, taking testosterone shots and having his breasts removed.</seg>
<seg id="58">Surgery rendered him infertile.</seg>
<seg id="59">Today, he advocates for others in an organization called the Interface Project, trying to normalize perceptions of those who are intersex.</seg>
<seg id="60">But Anne Tamar-Mattis, executive director for California-based legal group Advocates for Informed Choice, worries that the German law "invites labeling and stigma."</seg>
<seg id="61">"A lot of activists are concerned that what the German rule will do is encourage parents to make quick decisions and give the child an 'undetermined,'" she said.</seg>
<seg id="62">We are afraid it will encourage intervention.</seg>
<seg id="63">We think a better process is assigning male or female sex, then waiting.</seg>
<seg id="64">But we haven't seen how the law will play out, so all we can do is speculate.</seg>
<seg id="65">Tamar-Mattis said that her organization supports the Australian law because "it allows adults to choose to be recognized in a third gender."</seg>
<seg id="66">"Adults should be able to make their own decisions about legal gender," she said.</seg>
<seg id="67">German law is about assigning it at birth.</seg>
<seg id="68">That is not a battle young children should have to take up at this point.</seg>
<seg id="69">When they are grown, they can make decisions about their own bodies.</seg>
<seg id="70">But Dr. Arlene Baratz, a Pittsburgh breast radiologist who has a daughter with a disorder of sexual development and helps hundreds of others in a support group, said the German law will "empower" both parents and children.</seg>
<seg id="71">Baratz's daughter Katie was born with male chromosomes, but has a DSD called complete androgen insensitivity syndrome.</seg>
<seg id="72">Because her androgen receptors are faulty, Katie developed female characteristics.</seg>
<seg id="73">She has a vagina, but no uterus or ovaries.</seg>
<seg id="74">Now at 29, Katie is married and at the University of Pennsylvania, a resident in child psychiatry.</seg>
<seg id="75">Though she is infertile, she hopes to become a parent through adoption or gestational surrogacy.</seg>
<seg id="76">"The law gives parents some space not to have to rush into making decisions themselves," said Baratz.</seg>
<seg id="77">It gives them the time to do some tests and figure it out and a period of time before they write 'male' or 'female.'</seg>
<seg id="78">This way, you are OK -- raise the child, love the child.</seg>
<seg id="79">You have a wonderful baby and enjoy the fun.</seg>
<seg id="80">We don't have to rush into surgery that is irreversible.</seg>
<seg id="81">"It brings the children into the decision and takes away the anxiety that motivates parents because they don't feel they are doing the right thing," she said.</seg>
<seg id="82">Ultimately, the child will decide which sex he or she feels more comfortable with -- and that's a wonderful thing.</seg>
<seg id="83">It empowers children to make the decision for themselves.</seg>

<seg id="1">Report: Obama campaign considered dumping Biden for Hillary Clinton</seg>
<seg id="2">President Barack Obama's closest advisers secretly considered replacing Vice President Joe Biden with Hillary Clinton on the 2012 ticket, according to the New York Times.</seg>
<seg id="3">The revelation is the most notable bombshell from Mark Halperin and John Heilemann's heavily anticipated 2012 campaign tome, "Double Down: Game Change 2012."</seg>
<seg id="4">The Times obtained a copy of the forthcoming book and reported Thursday evening that the President's top aides conducted "extensive group-sessions and polling in late 2011" to gauge whether the dumping Biden could help bolster Obama's waning re-election hopes.</seg>
<seg id="5">According to the Times' national political correspondent Jonathan Martin, the book provides a thorough account of the effort by senior officials inside the campaign and the White House, namely former White House Chief of Staff Bill Daley, to measure what effect swapping former Secretary of State Clinton for the Vice President would have in the polls.</seg>
<seg id="6">The potential switch was a closely guarded secret within the Chicago campaign infrastructure and inside the Oval Office.</seg>
<seg id="7">Only half a dozen of the President's closest advisers -- including Daley, former Obama campaign chief Jim Messina, and former White House senior advisers David Axelrod and David Plouffe -- knew the change was under consideration.</seg>
<seg id="8">"Double Down" claims Daley spearheaded the effort to replace Biden, despite their "close personal rapport," before ultimately deciding against the move when their data showed adding Clinton to the ticket wouldn't "materially improve Obama's odds."</seg>
<seg id="9">In an interview with Martin, Daley confirmed that the administration did in fact consider replacing Biden with Clinton.</seg>
<seg id="10">"I was vocal about looking into a whole bunch of things, and this was one of them," Daley told the paper.</seg>
<seg id="11">You have to remember, at that point the President was in awful shape, so we were like, "Holy Christ, what do we do?"</seg>
<seg id="12">While Daley characterized the research as "due diligence," Martin told CNN's Anderson Cooper that the re-election campaign made a significant investment in finding out whether the move would pay dividends at the polls.</seg>
<seg id="13">"Campaigns don't spend the kind of money on polling and focus groups unless they're seriously considering something," Martin said on AC360.</seg>
<seg id="14">It's unclear, however, whether Obama knew his team was exploring the swap.</seg>
<seg id="15">Martin told CNN that he asked Daley whether his then-boss knew about the potential shuffle.</seg>
<seg id="16">While Daley said he doesn't think the President "was aware" of the potential change, the former chief of staff admitted that it's "possible" Obama knew.</seg>
<seg id="17">Martin added that "Double Down" does not definitively answer whether the political probing reached Obama's desk.</seg>
<seg id="18">Cooper asked Martin whether he seriously thought Obama did not know about the research into dumping Biden from the ticket.</seg>
<seg id="19">"Possibly," Martin replied.</seg>

<seg id="2">A British entrepreneur has created the world's first glow-in-the-dark ice cream - using jellyfish.</seg>
<seg id="3">Charlie Francis has harnessed the fluorescent properties of the marine animal to develop the luminescent snack.</seg>
<seg id="4">He came up with the idea after reading a research paper on jellyfish and convinced scientists in China to chemically recreate the glowing protein.</seg>
<seg id="5">The ice cream reacts with the eater's tongue - raising the pH level in the protein and making it glow.</seg>
<seg id="6">Chris says because the ice cream lights up when it reacts with the heat of the mouth it means the more you lick, the brighter it becomes.</seg>
<seg id="7">Charlie, founder of the "Lick Me I'm Delicious" ice cream company, said: "It is incredible stuff but still at very early days in terms of production, so £200 gets you about 2g of the stuff."</seg>
<seg id="8">The protein we are using in the ice cream reacts with your tongue at neutral pH.</seg>
<seg id="9">So as your mouth warms up the protein it will raise the pH level and the ice cream will glow.</seg>
<seg id="10">We have been testing it out over the past few months and it seemed perfect to share it over Halloween because it gives that wonderful glow effect.</seg>
<seg id="11">It is probably the most expensive ice cream I have made because the jellyfish luminescence is four times more expensive than gold.</seg>
<seg id="12">So each scoop costs me around £140.</seg>
<seg id="13">It tastes pretty good though.</seg>
<seg id="14">Charlie's experimental company, based in Bristol, is famed for its unusual flavours including beer, cheese, beef and gold leaf.</seg>
<seg id="15">But his next creation is set to be even more ambitious.</seg>
<seg id="16">He said: "I really want to develop an invisible ice cream."</seg>
<seg id="17">It is inherently impossible because of the refraction caused by the ice crystals which make up the ice cream, but I reckon we will find a way of doing it.</seg>
<seg id="18">The ice cream harnesses the fluorescent properties of a jellyfish, synthesized by Chinese scientists</seg>

<seg id="2">When I was little, Halloween was magical.</seg>
<seg id="3">My sister and I were allowed to eat candy, stay up late and play dress-up for the neighborhood.</seg>
<seg id="4">Nowadays, I've become more of a scrooge.</seg>
<seg id="5">I haven't signed up for the past two years to give out candy in my apartment and probably won't this year.</seg>
<seg id="6">But stats show that I'm a black sheep when it comes to Halloween.</seg>
<seg id="7">The majority of Americans - 158 million of them in fact - will be celebrating Halloween this year, spending a total of $6.9 billion on candy, costumes and decorations, according to the National Retail Federation.</seg>
<seg id="8">One thing I do look forward to every Halloween are the trends.</seg>
<seg id="9">Costumes are expected to account for $1.2 billion dollars out of the $6.9 billion spent, according to the NRF.</seg>
<seg id="10">This year, sexy inanimate objects are all the rage.</seg>
<seg id="11">Women don't have to be sexy professionals anymore; they can also be sexy foods like pizza, hamburgers and carrots.</seg>
<seg id="12">As for men, I expect we will be seeing a lot of zombies, thanks to The Walking Dead and I'll bet the Daft Punk space men will make it into our Instagram feeds this year.</seg>
<seg id="13">According to Google, the highest searched costumes are zombies, Batman, pirates and witches.</seg>
<seg id="14">I guess there's nothing wrong with going traditional.</seg>
<seg id="15">We dressed our dogs up last year and to my amazement we were not alone.</seg>
<seg id="16">In fact, Americans will spend $330 million on pet costumes this year, according to the NRF.</seg>
<seg id="17">That's a lot of ironic hotdog dogs.</seg>
<seg id="18">When it comes to candy, we don't screw around.</seg>
<seg id="19">Americans will spend $1.9 billion on it this year, according to The Nielsen Company.</seg>
<seg id="20">That's around 600 million pounds worth of Hershey bars, lollipops, Milk Duds, Twizzlers and Clark Bars.</seg>
<seg id="21">That's great news for the 41 million trick-or-treaters set to take over our neighborhoods, according to the U.S. Commerce Department.</seg>
<seg id="22">In fact, we will buy and, who are we kidding, consume 90 million pounds of chocolate during Halloween.</seg>
<seg id="23">The one thing we don't want to consume, candy corn; and yet nearly 35 million pounds of it are sold around Halloween, according to the National Confectioners Association.</seg>
<seg id="24">That's about 9 billion individual kernels of corn.</seg>
<seg id="25">It's a mystery I have yet to solve.</seg>
<seg id="26">Nothing is more quintessentially Halloween than haunted houses.</seg>
<seg id="27">They have the best names, like "Terror Behind the Walls" (which, by the way is in an actual prison), "Howl-O-Scream" and "The House of Shock."</seg>
<seg id="28">In fact, there are 1,200 officially sanctioned haunted houses in the United States generating about $500 million in revenue, according to America Haunts, and that includes those awesome photos of you mid-peeing your pants that your friend puts on Facebook and you can't take down and then that guy you like sees the photo and leaves a comment like "nice face."</seg>
<seg id="29">Finally, let's talk pumpkins.</seg>
<seg id="30">Charlie Brown introduced us to The Great Pumpkin when we were kids, and carving a jack-o-lantern is like decorating a Christmas tree - it's something we've done since we were little.</seg>
<seg id="31">Lucky for us, the "baby in a pumpkin trend" started only last year thanks to Pinterest, so most of us grew up carving these gourds not sitting in them.</seg>
<seg id="32">This year, Americans will spend around $106 million on pumpkins, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.</seg>
<seg id="33">The jack-o-lantern slowly withering on your front porch probably came from Illinois, which grew 542 million pounds of pumpkin this year.</seg>
<seg id="34">If you're looking for extra credit, call Tim and Susan Mathisdon in Napa, Calif., and try to carve up their 2,032 pound pumpkin.</seg>

<seg id="1">Schwarzenberg: Within two years we will have an early election here</seg>
<seg id="2">Chairman of TOP 09 Karel Schwarzenberg is expecting another early election soon.</seg>
<seg id="3">A week after the last election in an interview for Aktuálně.cz he said that there is no other way and each government formed as a result of voting last Friday and Saturday is an impossible patchwork.</seg>
<seg id="4">"It can’t last long," said Karel Schwarzenberg, adding that he predicts the lifetime of the starting electoral period will be two years.</seg>
<seg id="5">He disagrees with the objection that next time voters will make a completely different choice: "I think it will be a slightly more balanced decision."</seg>
<seg id="6">At the same time, the TOP 09 chairman will not admit that his party could lose more votes in another election than this year (compared with 2010 when they lost about 300,000 votes).</seg>
<seg id="7">Schwarzenberg estimates that if it were to become clear within two months that there will be an early election, it will strengthen Andrej Babiš’s ANO 2011.</seg>
<seg id="8">Otherwise, Schwarzenberg thinks Babiš will lose.</seg>
<seg id="9">Schwarzenberg gives his own commentary on the turbulent situation in ČSSD, where the chairman, Bohuslav Sobotka, declared after the secret meeting of the part of the party leadership at Lany, that either he or Michal Hašek would remain in the leadership of the Social Democrats:</seg>
<seg id="10">"The leading officials of the Democratic party are like little boys going after the head of state, to allow them make a change in the party."</seg>
<seg id="11">"I thought Mr Hašek was smarter and more intelligent."</seg>
<seg id="12">"Because I have never seen anything done so impatiently and stupidly like that," added the TOP 09 chairman.</seg>
<seg id="13">And referring to President Zeman (with whom he clashed in the fight for the presidency), he said: "The role of head of state is clear: He wants to usurp the party."</seg>
<seg id="14">TOP 09 has already submitted the first laws.</seg>
<seg id="15">What was the biggest surprise of the election for you?</seg>
<seg id="16">TOP 09 has already formally submitted its first bills in the Chamber, including Farský’s register of contracts, which was discussed by parliamentary committees prior to the election but with the early election it ended up under the table.</seg>
<seg id="17">The TOP 09 chairman in the interview for Aktuálně.cz says that this speed is because "these laws are necessary."</seg>
<seg id="18">At the same time, however, TOP 09 clearly wants to beat similar attempts by other parties.</seg>
<seg id="19">For example, the electoral leader of ANO, Martin Komárek accused TOP 09 in the pre-election battle that with the idea to introduce a register of contracts it was "stealing" the ANO programme.</seg>
<seg id="20">TOP 09 is now using its advantage – it just dusted off the bill it had that was already heading for the second parliamentary reading.</seg>

<seg id="2">Cocker spaniel Ruby had run off after she was in a minor road crash</seg>
<seg id="3">She was spotted three days later by a dog walker trapped in the quarry</seg>
<seg id="4">Firefighters abseil down cliff face to pluck the dog from certain death</seg>
<seg id="5">A puppy had a lucky escape after fire crews were called to lift her to safety when she somehow got herself stuck 50ft up on a precarious cliff ledge.</seg>
<seg id="6">Nine month-old cocker spaniel Ruby had run off after being involved in a road crash on Sunday afternoon and survived three days alone before being rescued from a quarry on Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="7">Her owners Scott Alderson, 25, and his girlfriend Becky Hall, 20, were at Flappit Quarry in Denholme, West Yorkshire, to be reunited with Ruby and have thanked West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service.</seg>
<seg id="8">They had searched frantically for their missing dog and posted appeals on social networking sites after she had ran into the quarry following the minor accident.</seg>
<seg id="9">At around 2.15pm on Wednesday, an eagle-eyed dog walker spotted Ruby on the ledge in the quarry, stranded 50ft up.</seg>
<seg id="10">A Technical Rescue Team from Cleckheaton Fire Station rushed to the scene and abseiled down to rescue Ruby and used a pet tube to transport her up the cliff.</seg>
<seg id="11">Specialist Technical Rescue Officer Andy Clayton said: 'She was in a precarious situation.</seg>
<seg id="12">She was right in the middle of the cliff face - 50ft from the top and bottom.</seg>
<seg id="13">She did not move a muscle during the rescue - she was frozen solid.</seg>
<seg id="14">But she is fine now.</seg>
<seg id="15">She was eating biscuits afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="16">This was a very unusual call-out.</seg>
<seg id="17">The fact that the dog was spotted is unbelievable.</seg>
<seg id="18">Specialist Technical Rescue Officer Peter Lau said: "Ruby had a very lucky escape."</seg>
<seg id="19">The potential was there that she could have been very seriously injured or worse.</seg>
<seg id="20">Ruby was taken to the vets for a check-up and was found to be fine other than exhaustion and dehydration.</seg>
<seg id="21">Miss Hall, from Halifax, West Yorkshire, said: "Watching the rescue was terrifying."</seg>
<seg id="22">I could not believe that she was up there in the first place.</seg>
<seg id="23">It was amazing to get her back in our arms.</seg>
<seg id="24">The vet said that if she became too exhausted and collapsed she would probably have fallen.</seg>
<seg id="25">The firefighters were amazing.</seg>
<seg id="26">It was really daring what they did.</seg>
<seg id="27">We are just so grateful and every single one of them was absolutely tremendous.</seg>
<seg id="28">Mr Alderson, from Keighley, added: "We were scared that she might fall but she stayed there."</seg>
<seg id="29">The firefighters were brilliant.</seg>

<seg id="1">George Kerevan: Europe break-up gives Scots choice</seg>
<seg id="2">Another day, another independence scare story.</seg>
<seg id="3">This time we are warned that an independent Scotland would be required to join the Europe-wide free-travel zone as a condition of EU membership.</seg>
<seg id="4">Cue stories about passport controls at Berwick and a barbed wire border along Hadrian's Wall.</seg>
<seg id="5">True, the Strathclyde paper pointed out the possible economic benefits of freer movement with the rest of Europe, though - predictably - that did not figure in the headlines.</seg>
<seg id="6">Nor did anyone point out that the EU member states spend much of their time bending their formal rules if it suits them.</seg>
<seg id="7">Since Scotland isn't in the Schengen area now, continued non-compliance would be a cheap concession for Brussels to offer up in return for whatever it really wanted out of the Scots.</seg>
<seg id="8">So, a non-story, then.</seg>
<seg id="9">And one that is so long in the tooth it has become fossilised: I first heard the "independence means passport controls" canard at least 40 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="10">Yet there is an interesting point lost in this retelling of a whiskery old tale.</seg>
<seg id="11">Why should an independent Scotland be expected to do Europe's bidding, anyway?</seg>
<seg id="12">Why trade London's yoke for that of Brussels, especially now?</seg>
<seg id="13">Here is the real European news: the great, post-war plan to unite Europe has finally stalled.</seg>
<seg id="14">With the euro crisis, Project Europe is officially dead.</seg>
<seg id="15">Across the EU, parties which are dedicated to opposing the EU, or to scrapping the euro as a common currency, are gaining ground.</seg>
<seg id="16">Even in Germany, the Eurosceptic Alternative for Germany Party - founded only this year - came from nowhere to grab nearly five million votes in September's federal elections, thus effectively knocking the Free Democrats (equivalent to our own Lib Dems) out of the Bundestag.</seg>
<seg id="17">There has always been domestic opposition to the plan to create a federal Europe.</seg>
<seg id="18">However, the current economic crisis has proved a watershed.</seg>
<seg id="19">The austerity imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank, coupled with the straitjacket imposed on national economies through adherence to the common currency, has led many people to think Project Europe has gone too far.</seg>
<seg id="20">The crisis of the euro has little to do with national governments running excessive budget deficits - that was true only of Greece.</seg>
<seg id="21">Rather, the euro system locked in its members at exchange rates favourable to German exporters - something German politicians want to keep.</seg>
<seg id="22">Without the possibility of domestic currency devaluation, southern Europe finds itself with a built-in productivity disadvantage vis-à-vis Germany.</seg>
<seg id="23">The only recourse is to slash wages and public spending - spurred on by Berlin.</seg>
<seg id="24">Beyond the current budget and currency problems lies a deeper European productivity malaise.</seg>
<seg id="25">As a result of "green" energy policies imposed by Brussels - code for subsidising French and German energy firms at the consumer's expense - European industry pays twice as much for electricity, and four times as much for gas, as in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="26">That is a crippling cost disadvantage, as we've already seen at Grangemouth.</seg>
<seg id="27">All the wage freezes in the world won't stop the European petrochemicals industry being hammered by cheap US shale gas.</seg>
<seg id="28">As a result, revolt is brewing, especially in France, once the EU's main cheerleader.</seg>
<seg id="29">After the war, the French political elite saw the EU as a vehicle to keep Germany in check, and to give Paris equal billing in the world with Washington.</seg>
<seg id="30">But Berlin no longer needs Paris as a passport to political legitimacy and has imposed its own economic policy on Europe, leaving the battered French economy struggling.</seg>
<seg id="31">Result: Marine Le Pen's right-wing, anti-EU National Front has just won a crucial by-election, knocking the ruling Socialists into third place.</seg>
<seg id="32">The Front is now the most popular party in France with 24 per cent of the vote - a timely warning to British Labour that they can't assume a split on the right will automatically favour the left.</seg>
<seg id="33">What is Le Pen doing with her newfound popularity among the French white, working class?</seg>
<seg id="34">She wants to use next year's EU elections to create an anti-EU, anti-common currency bloc across the European Parliament.</seg>
<seg id="35">If, as is very possible, anti-EU parties do well in these elections, such a bloc could dominate the European Parliament for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="36">Here's my point: sometime soon growing anti-EU and anti-common currency feeling in Europe will coalesce to kill the euro.</seg>
<seg id="37">The EU won't disappear, but it will revert to something more like the loose "Europe of the (Sovereign) Nations" favoured by General de Gaulle.</seg>
<seg id="38">Germany and a few of its satellite economies might keep the euro but France and southern Europe will revive their own currencies.</seg>
<seg id="39">I expect the UK will distance itself from this project, hoping to cosy up to the US.</seg>
<seg id="40">However, Washington's growing interest in the Pacific suggests Britain will be left out in the Atlantic cold.</seg>
<seg id="41">Where does this leave Scotland?</seg>
<seg id="42">We can choose to be a region of (essentially) Little England.</seg>
<seg id="43">Or we can defend our own economic interests - which includes telling Berlin and Brussels where to get off.</seg>
<seg id="44">I suspect that Scotland could do well inside a looser European arrangement provided we kept our own currency.</seg>
<seg id="45">Co-operation with other like-minded countries will be easier in a non-federal Europe of the Nations.</seg>
<seg id="46">Otherwise we should consider emulating Norway and retaining our economic independence.</seg>
<seg id="47">The SNP government in Scotland is - remarkably-- the most successful anti-austerity political movement in Europe, having won a spectacular majority in 2011 on the basis of opposing the cuts proposed (and implemented) by Labour's chancellor Alistair Darling and the subsequent Tory-Lib Dem coalition.</seg>
<seg id="48">It would be ridiculous now for Scotland to vote for independence only to accept austerity imposed by Berlin and Brussels.</seg>

<seg id="1">Early puberty: Growing older sooner</seg>
<seg id="2">African-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty earlier than their white counterparts, research shows.</seg>
<seg id="3">Physical changes don't mean puberty is imminent</seg>
<seg id="4">There's no evidence that hormones or other chemicals are to blame</seg>
<seg id="5">Experts think the obesity epidemic might be one trigger of early puberty</seg>
<seg id="6">The trend toward early puberty is not as pronounced with boys</seg>
<seg id="7">Former CNN correspondent Pat Etheridge is a journalist specializing in children's health and family issues.</seg>
<seg id="8">Should a mother be alarmed if her daughter begins to sprout breast buds and pubic hair at 7 or 8?</seg>
<seg id="9">At the annual conference of the American Academy of Pediatrics this week in Orlando, Florida, pediatric endocrinologist Dr. Paul Kaplowitz explained that these early physical changes are quite common among American girls and represent a new norm.</seg>
<seg id="10">"I spend a lot of time reassuring parents -- usually, this does not signal a rapid progression into full puberty," said Kaplowitz.</seg>
<seg id="11">Obvious signs of development, such as budding breasts, pubic and underarm hair and body odor are appearing sooner in girls.</seg>
<seg id="12">But there has been only a slight shift in the age of menarche (the first period) over the past four decades.</seg>
<seg id="13">In the United States, the average age is 12.5 years, down from 12.75 in 1970.</seg>
<seg id="14">"Once breasts begin to develop, it takes at least two to three years before menarche," said Kaplowitz, also author of "Early Puberty in Girls: The Essential Guide to Coping with This Common Problem."</seg>
<seg id="15">Time is the most accurate test of how puberty is going to progress.</seg>
<seg id="16">There is debate about what constitutes the actual onset of puberty, but it is considered "precocious" when breast enlargement is accompanied by a growth spurt before age 8.</seg>
<seg id="17">In most cases, the process will slow down or stall -- something a pediatrician can monitor closely.</seg>
<seg id="18">A more rapid progression may warrant tests by an endocrinologist to rule out serious problems such as tumors or cysts.</seg>
<seg id="19">There are treatments to delay early menses and ward off another consequence: premature aging of the bones that ultimately can lead to stunted growth and being short as an adult.</seg>
<seg id="20">Recommendations for drug or hormone therapy are based on the child's age, rate of development, growth rate and emotional maturity.</seg>
<seg id="21">Psychosocial aspects are important, too.</seg>
<seg id="22">Kaplowitz is cautious with medication but acknowledges, "suppressing puberty may alleviate behavioral issues and girls' feelings of being different from peers."</seg>
<seg id="23">The other big issue is understandable: Parents simply don't want their very young daughters having periods.</seg>
<seg id="24">"They worry about the risk of pregnancy or even how they will handle hygiene," said Kaplowitz.</seg>
<seg id="25">"It was a shock," recalls one woman whose daughter started her period at 10.</seg>
<seg id="26">Even though there were signs and we had talked about menstruation, she was not emotionally prepared.</seg>
<seg id="27">She came home from school scared and upset to be the first among her friends.</seg>
<seg id="28">There are lots of well-publicized theories about the causes of precocious puberty.</seg>
<seg id="29">Yet, there's no consistent body of evidence that hormones in milk or other foods, chemicals in the environment or sexual messages in the media are to blame.</seg>
<seg id="30">Boys - like girls - are hitting puberty earlier.</seg>
<seg id="31">Kaplowitz contends the premise that holds the most weight is the epidemic of obesity.</seg>
<seg id="32">He helped conduct a 2001 study of 6- to 9-year-old girls that links body fat to the timing of puberty.</seg>
<seg id="33">Other findings support this conclusion, but there are many other contributing factors.</seg>
<seg id="34">In this country, African-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty earlier than their white counterparts.</seg>
<seg id="35">There are varying explanations.</seg>
<seg id="36">Globally, patterns of early puberty appear to be influenced by everything from economic conditions to climate to genes.</seg>
<seg id="37">Another conundrum: Although boys are getting facial and pubic hair at younger ages, the trend toward full-blown early puberty is not as pronounced as it is with girls.</seg>
<seg id="38">Other doctors attending the AAP conference reinforced the complexities of the topic.</seg>
<seg id="39">The appearance of acne and pubic hair is common even in infants and toddlers.</seg>
<seg id="40">"We need to be careful about how we identify the true onset of puberty," said Dr. Lawrence Silverman, a pediatric endocrinologist at Goryeb Children's Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.</seg>
<seg id="41">Parents should not hesitate to get guidance from their pediatrician about how to talk with their child.</seg>
<seg id="42">"It may mean having a sooner-than-expected conversation," Kaplowitz advised.</seg>
<seg id="43">If you remain calm, your child usually will respond well.</seg>
<seg id="44">Girls who blossom early need reassurance that, even when it happens ahead of schedule, the process is a normal part of life.</seg>

<seg id="1">Jet makers feud over seat width with big orders at stake</seg>
<seg id="2">A row has flared up between leading plane makers over the width of tourist-class seats on long-distance flights, setting the tone for a bitter confrontation at this month's Dubai Airshow.</seg>
<seg id="3">The dispute focuses on the width of seats provided on long-haul flights for economy passengers - not always the ones most courted by airlines, but whose allocated space holds the key to efficiency claims for the latest jets offered by Airbus SAS and Boeing Co.</seg>
<seg id="4">Airbus this week called for an industry standard that would provide for a seat at least 18 inches (46 cm) wide in economy cabins, but its U.S. arch-rival Boeing says it should be for airlines to decide.</seg>
<seg id="5">The dispute comes as plane makers vie to sell ever-larger versions of their twin-engined long-distance aircraft, with potentially record orders expected at the November 17-21 event.</seg>
<seg id="6">How the back of the plane is laid out - particularly whether seating is 9 or 10 abreast - is central to the economic performance claims being made for new "mini-jumbo" jet designs.</seg>
<seg id="7">Boeing says its revamped "777X" will hold 406 people based on economy seats more than 17 inches wide and set out 10 in each row.</seg>
<seg id="8">Airbus says the competing version of its A350 will carry 350 people in 18-inch-wide economy seat laid out 9 abreast.</seg>
<seg id="9">Plane giants often trade blows on technical matters through advertising in the trade press.</seg>
<seg id="10">Now, Airbus is appealing directly to the public ahead of the Dubai Airshow, where the 777X is expected to dominate with more than 100 orders.</seg>
<seg id="11">It recently previewed what may be the start of a new ad war by showing financiers a slide illustrating three people squashed together at a restaurant, titled "Would You Accept This?"</seg>
<seg id="12">"Boeing is proposing long-distance flying in seats narrower than regional turbo-props," said Airbus sales chief John Leahy.</seg>
<seg id="13">As diets change, people get bigger but plane seating has not radically changed.</seg>
<seg id="14">Between the early 1970s, when the Boeing 747 jumbo defined modern long-haul travel, and the turn of the century, the weight of the average American 40- to 49-year-old male increased by 10 per cent, according to U.S. Health Department Data.</seg>
<seg id="15">The waist of the average 21st-century American male is 39.7 inches, according to U.S. health statistics.</seg>
<seg id="16">Airbus says its rival is sticking to a seat concept from the 1950s, when the average girth of the newly christened "jet set" was narrower.</seg>
<seg id="17">Airbus says it has commissioned research suggesting an extra inch in seat width improves sleep quality by 53 per cent.</seg>
<seg id="18">Boeing disputes Airbus's figures on seat measurements and says it is not up to manufacturers to step into decisions on how airlines balance fares and facilities.</seg>
<seg id="19">It also says research shows cabin experience depends on more than the width of a seat.</seg>
<seg id="20">"It really comes down to providing flexibility to airlines and allowing them to do the things that they believe they need to do to be successful," said Boeing cabins expert Kent Craver.</seg>
<seg id="21">They don't want us to dictate to them what makes them profitable.</seg>
<seg id="22">They know their business better than anyone else.</seg>
<seg id="23">For flyers it is about more elbow room, but for suppliers it is increasingly an issue that could affect earnings.</seg>
<seg id="24">Behind the dispute is a race for plane orders with at least $700-billion of estimated business at list prices in coming decades, enough to tip the scales of U.S. and European exports.</seg>
<seg id="25">As Reuters first reported in July, seat layout is exactly what drives the battle between the latest jets.</seg>
<seg id="26">Both Airbus and Boeing claim 20 per cent better efficiency per seat in their latest twin-engined long-haul designs than the market leader in that segment, the 365-seat Boeing 777-300ER.</seg>
<seg id="27">Boeing's performance claims depend in part on comparing the 10-abreast 777X with an original 9-abreast 777 design.</seg>
<seg id="28">The gain in unit costs is blunted compared with 10-abreast now in use.</seg>
<seg id="29">"The reason Boeing are doing this is to cram more seats in to make their plane more competitive with our products," said Kevin Keniston, head of passenger comfort at Europe's Airbus.</seg>
<seg id="30">On the other hand, analysts say full 10-seat-per-row cabins for existing 777s suggest many passengers are voting for the denser layout, which may go hand in hand with cheaper fares.</seg>
<seg id="31">"Eighteen inches in seat width would be great for passengers, but the reality is that from a business point of the Airbus proposal is driven by the threat of the 777," said cabin interiors expert Mary Kirby, founder and editor of the Runway Girl Network.</seg>
<seg id="32">Airbus and Boeing do not supply seats but offer a catalogue of suppliers for airlines to choose from.</seg>
<seg id="33">Globe-trotting jet sellers even carry tape measures to check on competing layouts.</seg>
<seg id="34">While boasting comfort, all builders also offer jets with high-density layouts for low-cost airlines and regional travel.</seg>
<seg id="35">Airbus offers a 10-abreast A350 but says it has not yet sold it.</seg>
<seg id="36">Until recently, Airbus was stressing the need for more cabin customization by offering wider aisle seats on some of its jets.</seg>
<seg id="37">Without the support of the only other maker of large modern jets, experts say its call for a new industry standard is unlikely to fly, but could distract from a wave of 777X sales.</seg>

<seg id="1">The number of people affected by HIV exceeds one thousand in Prague</seg>
<seg id="2">The number of people affected increases every year in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="3">For example, tests in 2002 confirmed the infection in 50 people, five years later there were already 121 and in 2010 there were already 180.</seg>
<seg id="4">Last year there were 212 people infected and this was a record number.</seg>
<seg id="5">"There is already no doubt in my opinion that the total number of newly diagnosed cases will exceed 200 this year," stated Miroslav Hlavatý, expert in the issue of AIDS, who was head of Prague’s House of Light for patients for years.</seg>
<seg id="6">He says that last year from January to September there were another 165 patients with HIV, this year there were 176 during the same period.</seg>
<seg id="7">From the start of monitoring to the end of this September, tests confirmed HIV in 1710 men and 353 women, with the most infected people in Prague.</seg>
<seg id="8">Their number in September reached 1005.</seg>
<seg id="9">In Central Bohemia Region, there were 206 residents infected.</seg>
<seg id="10">A diagnosis was heard by 156 people in South Moravia Region, 130 in Moravia-Silesia Region and 116 in the Ústí nad Labem Region.</seg>
<seg id="11">The fewest infected persons are in Vysočina, there are 19.</seg>
<seg id="12">In total, 88 per cent of patients were infected during sex.</seg>
<seg id="13">Fourteen people in the past have been infected by blood transfusion.</seg>
<seg id="14">Such cases, however, have not appeared in the Czech Republic since the beginning of testing, that is, for over 25 years,.</seg>
<seg id="15">Six children have also been born with HIV, transferred to them from the mother.</seg>

<seg id="1">There is nonsense in the film Gravity, but it is a beautiful sight, say experts</seg>
<seg id="2">The fantasy film from space, Gravity, was for some time after its premiere a sell-out at Czech cinemas.</seg>
<seg id="3">In October, according to the Union of Film Distributors, almost 150,000 people saw it and it made over 26 million crowns.</seg>
<seg id="4">The majority of reviews have evaluated the film positively.</seg>
<seg id="5">Others, however, have found some inconsistencies.</seg>
<seg id="6">The server Lidovky.cz asked experts from among a number of astronomers and astrophysicists what they thought of the film and if they had noticed any nonsense that appeared in the film.</seg>
<seg id="7">Jiří Dušek (director of the Brno Observatory and Planetarium): I like sci-fi films which I consider modern, dreamlike fairy tales.</seg>
<seg id="8">Gravity is no exception, although it gives appearance as a "physically realistic" performance.</seg>
<seg id="9">It isn’t, but that doesn’t mean it was bad.</seg>
<seg id="10">I really enjoyed it.</seg>
<seg id="11">You can notice, for example, Sandra Bullock’s hair, which somehow doesn’t float in zero gravity.</seg>
<seg id="12">The Hubble Space Telescope and the International Space Station move in significantly different orbits, so they cannot be seen in one shot.</seg>
<seg id="13">Some viewers are reproaching the film for the unrealistic effect and the behaviour of fire in general in zero gravity.</seg>
<seg id="14">They also say the space suits would not withstand such blows.</seg>
<seg id="15">The heroes of Gravity often collide with various objects and the clothes withstand everything without much problems.</seg>
<seg id="16">The storyline was not spared criticism either.</seg>
<seg id="17">According to some discussions, such an extensive tragedy in Earth’s orbit is unrealistic.</seg>
<seg id="18">They also wonder why the doctor was sent to space to fix the equipment.</seg>
<seg id="19">People in forums also argue about the ropes’ "unrealistic" behaviour.</seg>
<seg id="20">They apparently look as if they were designed for bungee jumping.</seg>
<seg id="21">Marcel Grün (director of the Prague Observatory and Planetarium): I have only seen it so far on a wide screen, but I can definitely say I was enchanted.</seg>
<seg id="22">I am glad it wasn’t a documentary but science fiction.</seg>
<seg id="23">And in that kind of story, the author is entitled (almost obliged) not to stick firmly to reality.</seg>
<seg id="24">"More than the inconsistencies you mentioned, what concerned me was how the space station was shown three times with a deteriorating level of technology (the last time the Chinese one)."</seg>
<seg id="25">"After all, it will be the Chinese one only at the end of the decade and it will probably look better than it is in the film."</seg>
<seg id="26">Vladimír Karas (Director of the Astronomical Institute of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic):  In computer-generated scenes the authors have very successfully tried not to break physical laws, and so the natural-science orientated viewer can appreciate that in various cosmic collisions and crashes, the moment of  movement ,to use terminology of physics, is quite correctly preserved, the view of Earth from space is also very realistic including the thin atmospheric shell and the aurora flickering in the polar regions.</seg>
<seg id="27">Inconsistencies will definitely be found on closer examination.</seg>
<seg id="28">In addition, for example, when reading comments, I found that the preferred direction of circulation of various space debris in orbit in some scenes appears in reverse than how it should be in reality (from west to east).</seg>
<seg id="29">Jiří Štěpán (employee at the Astronomical Institute of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic): The filmmakers adapted some things to their needs, but I saw no major or shocking violations against logic or natural laws in the film and in comparison with other films with a similar focus, it is clear that the filmmakers did their best to make the events seem credible.</seg>
<seg id="30">Of the moments that do not make sense, it is worth mentioning the fact that the Hubble Space Telescope has a different orbit than the ISS.</seg>
<seg id="31">As a result, they have a significantly different relative speed and the rescue operation could not actually have gone the way it was shown in the film.</seg>
<seg id="32">Also, in the moment of separating Kowalski (Clooney) and Stone (Bullock), I did not notice that the whole ISS rotated, so it is not actually clear what the origin of the strength acting on Kowalski was, which forced both actors to let go at the moment when they were not moving against each other.</seg>

<seg id="1">New anti-nicotine vaccine could take the pleasure out of smoking</seg>
<seg id="2">Scientists have developed an anti-nicotine vaccine that could take the pleasure out of smoking a cigarette.</seg>
<seg id="3">A single dose of the vaccine was able to protect mice against nicotine addiction for life.</seg>
<seg id="4">Further tests are needed before starting human trials, which would take several years, but Professor Ronald Crystal of Weill Cornell Medical College in New York said the early signs are good.</seg>
<seg id="5">"We are very hopeful that this kind of vaccine strategy can finally help the millions of smokers who have tried to stop, exhausting all the methods on the market today, but find their nicotine addiction to be strong enough to overcome these current approaches," Prof Cornell said.</seg>
<seg id="6">The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that has been engineered to carry the genetic information to make anti-nicotine antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="7">The virus selectively infects liver cells, which then start to make a steady stream of the antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="8">The antibodies hunt down any nicotine molecules in the bloodstream, neutralising them before they reached the brain, preventing a smoker from getting a nicotine hit.</seg>
<seg id="9">In tests, vaccinated mice who were subsequently given nicotine continued with their normal activity.</seg>
<seg id="10">But mice who had not been given the vaccine "chilled out," say the researchers, a sign that the nicotine had reached their brains.</seg>
<seg id="11">The experiments are described in the journal Science Translational Medicine.</seg>
<seg id="12">Previous tobacco vaccines failed because they contained antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="13">The jabs had to be given so frequently to keep antibody levels topped up that they proved expensive and impractical.</seg>
<seg id="14">But the cost of the new vaccine is likely to be far lower, because it turns liver cells into antibody factories.</seg>
<seg id="15">Prof Crystal said that if a future human vaccine was completely safe it could be given to children before they were tempted to try a cigarette, preventing nicotine addiction.</seg>
<seg id="16">But more likely it would be used by smokers to quit.</seg>
<seg id="17">"They will know if they start smoking again, they will receive no pleasure from it due to the nicotine vaccine, and that can help them kick the habit," he said.</seg>
<seg id="18">British scientists said the results were interesting but warned far more research was needed.</seg>

<seg id="1">Tripodi denies being influenced by Obeid</seg>
<seg id="2">Former NSW Labor minister Joe Tripodi will be investigated by the state's corruption watchdog.</seg>
<seg id="3">Former NSW minister Joe Tripodi has denied changing maritime leases policy at the request of his political mentor Eddie Obeid, who had hidden interests in three properties on government-controlled land.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) on Friday widened its inquiry into whether Mr Obeid lobbied several state ministers to have leases at Circular Quay, where the Obeids owned two restaurants and a cafe, renewed without going to tender after their expiration in August 2005.</seg>
<seg id="5">It's now investigating allegations Mr Tripodi knew of Mr Obeid's secret interest in the properties, after evidence given by Mr Tripodi's former deputy chief of staff, Lynne Ashpole, on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="6">During years of discussions starting in 2005 the government had been pushing for the leases to go to public tender.</seg>
<seg id="7">The lessees were against this and also wanted longer terms.</seg>
<seg id="8">In 2009 leases for the Circular Quay enterprises, which earned the Obeids about $2.5 million annually, were renewed without going to public tender.</seg>
<seg id="9">Mr Tripodi, who was ports minister from February 2006 until November 2009, was initially in favour of public tenders.</seg>
<seg id="10">But he denied the changes were made at the request of Mr Obeid, who Mr Tripodi acknowledged was urging a shift in government lease policy.</seg>
<seg id="11">A phone transcript tabled in ICAC showed calls in August and September 2007 between Mr Obeid, Mr Tripodi and Steve Dunn, a senior bureaucrat who had come into the ports ministry after working under Mr Obeid in the fisheries department.</seg>
<seg id="12">"Was the matter being discussed in the course of these telephone conversations the development of the commercial lease policy," Assistant Commissioner Anthony Whealy asked Mr Tripodi.</seg>
<seg id="13">"No," Mr Tripodi replied.</seg>
<seg id="14">I can't remember what was discussed but it definitely wasn't that.</seg>
<seg id="15">Definitely not between myself and Mr Obeid.</seg>

<seg id="1">Many things have moved, and everything is different.</seg>
<seg id="2">For instance, the commentator Pečinka spoke in such a way that it was possible to agree with it, whereas chairman Štěch stirred up discord.</seg>
<seg id="3">I was suspicious of Governor Chovanec as soon as they elected him to the presidency, and that was confirmed.</seg>
<seg id="4">Chairman Sobotka always was and continues to be a symbol of the misery of ČSSD.</seg>
<seg id="5">The other gentlemen have mainly shown their weaknesses.</seg>
<seg id="6">Senator Dienstbier is consistent and readable and unusable, Vice-Chairman Zaorálek embarrassed himself most in a television interview.</seg>
<seg id="7">On the basis of this, I see no better option than for ČSSD to nominate as the Premier the Vice-Chairperson of the Senate Gajdůšková; she is the only one without a starting handicap and I think she would deliver a standard performance.</seg>
<seg id="8">It is such a good solution that hardly anyone in leadership will support it.</seg>
<seg id="9">I should add that this solution is the only option to forget what happened and continue without tearing the party apart.</seg>
<seg id="10">Alena Gajdůšková could easily form a minority government with only a blessing from Chairman Babiš and without the Christian Democrats, but with Christian Democrat Minister of Health Hovorka, who is actually a faithful Social Democrat.</seg>
<seg id="11">This mini-minority government would have a great stability because it would promote the proper law for a referendum and Chairman of Dawn, Okamura, is also committed to support this.</seg>
<seg id="12">Chairman Babiš was eventually reconciled with taxation progression, since he is clever and will see that it is impossible without it.</seg>
<seg id="13">The Christian Democrats would not present problems, because Hovorka is the bearer of the best they have and they would not otherwise be in the government.</seg>
<seg id="14">The same applies to ANO, even here a valuable minister could be found, but when they sensibly do not want to enter into risky government participation, but will provide support, that is also good.</seg>
<seg id="15">Let’s encourage Alena Gajdůšková!</seg>

<seg id="1">Foreign workers on 457 visas could undergo "genuineness" test</seg>
<seg id="2">A "genuineness" test for foreign workers on 457 visas is being considered by the government as it contemplates expanding a crackdown.</seg>
<seg id="3">The test, if adopted, would be applied through a criteria aimed at preventing 457s being used to fill unskilled positions or as a back door way to move family and friends to Australia.</seg>
<seg id="4">A government discussion paper was released today as former Labor MP Maxine McKew slammed the government's rhetoric about foreign workers, saying it could offend Australia's neighbours.</seg>
<seg id="5">"Loud declarations about 'foreigners getting to the back of the queue' and 'Aussie jobs first' are a very unpleasant throwback to a time when unions demanded a protected labor market," she told the Australia India Institute today.</seg>
<seg id="6">Historically, that meant it was white labour that had to be protected - and if some in the region saw echoes of that historic artifact, I wouldn't be surprised.</seg>
<seg id="7">The discussion paper outlines 12 measures that were previously considered by former Immigration Minister Chris Bowen.</seg>
<seg id="8">Immigration Minister Brendan O'Connor, who was yesterday in Sri Lanka where he is meeting officials about people smuggling, has implemented five of the recommended changes with the remainder under consideration.</seg>
<seg id="9">If the "genuineness" criteria was adopted a visa applicant could be scrutinised about "whether the nomination is genuine in circumstances where the nominee is a relation or personal associate of an owner or relevant person of the sponsoring business."</seg>
<seg id="10">Businesses could also be required to account for the number of 457 visa holders after previously businesses who had intended to sponsor a small number of workers then employed hundreds.</seg>

<seg id="1">A study aiming to increase the benefits to Scotland of the HS2 rail project has been announced by the UK government.</seg>
<seg id="2">The work by HS2 Ltd suggests high-speed services to Scotland and the north of England will start as soon as Phase One opens in 2026.</seg>
<seg id="3">Transport minister Baroness Kramer said the project would "bring the UK together."</seg>
<seg id="4">Scottish transport minister Keith Brown said he was "excited" to work with the UK government on the plan.</seg>
<seg id="5">Phase One will consist of a new high speed rail line between London and the West Midlands.</seg>
<seg id="6">When Phase Two is completed, lines will run to Manchester and Leeds.</seg>
<seg id="7">In June the government revised the estimated cost of building the high-speed link between London and the North of England from £32.7bn to £42.6bn.</seg>
<seg id="8">The UK government, which has been holding talks with Transport Scotland, has instructed HS2 Ltd to look at further rail capacity and journey time improvements for northern England and Scotland.</seg>
<seg id="9">This is to include the possibility of eventual journey times from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London of three hours or less.</seg>
<seg id="10">Baroness Kramer said: "Our goal for HS2 is for a truly national network that will bring the UK and its cities closer together."</seg>
<seg id="11">We are driving forward HS2 because the benefits it will bring are huge.</seg>
<seg id="12">Without it we face a crisis in capacity on our rail network.</seg>
<seg id="13">But it is also about connectivity, across the UK 18 cities including Glasgow and Edinburgh will be better connected because of HS2.</seg>
<seg id="14">Scottish Secretary Alistair Carmichael added: "Today's announcement is good news for Scotland."</seg>
<seg id="15">For the Scottish government, Keith Brown called on Mr Carmichael to "unequivocally" back Scotland's inclusion in the HS2 network.</seg>
<seg id="16">Mr Brown said: "High speed rail has the potential to bring huge economic benefits to Scotland, but also adds Scotland's economic weight to the overall case for high speed rail across Britain."</seg>
<seg id="17">So we are excited to work in partnership with the UK Government to examine options for bringing high speed rail to Scotland, creating benefit for all and complementing the Glasgow-Edinburgh line which the Scottish Government is already planning.</seg>
<seg id="18">I look forward to reviewing the report of the investigation with UK ministers next year and together decide on the next steps.</seg>

<seg id="1">Anti-corruption police analyst arrested by inspectorate together with Bárta</seg>
<seg id="2">Information about the arrest of Vít Bárta began to spread on Thursday evening, when the news was brought by the server Prvnízpravy.cz.</seg>
<seg id="3">MF DNES soon discovered that the General Inspectorate of the Security Forces (GIBS) was in charge of the case; its people were arresting Bárta in the centre of Prague.</seg>
<seg id="4">It took place outside the Four Seasons Hotel.</seg>
<seg id="5">The inspectorate solves cases where the defendants include police, although the jurisdiction also applies to civilians.</seg>
<seg id="6">According to MF DNES, the detainees include one of the officers of the anti-corruption police – the head of the analytics and informatics division Jan Petržílek.</seg>
<seg id="7">He has previously worked for the Security Intelligence Service (BIS).</seg>
<seg id="8">Anti-corruption police spokesman Jaroslav Ibehej refused to comment on the information, however, adding that the media must in this case contact the GIBS.</seg>
<seg id="9">Radka Sandorová, spokesperson for the inspectorate, did not want to say anything about the case, referring immediately to the Prague Municipal Prosecutor’s Office.</seg>
<seg id="10">"We will not comment on this query with regard to the protection of classified information," said Štěpánka Zenklová, spokesperson for the Prosecutor’s Office.</seg>
<seg id="11">From this vague reaction, it can also be deduced that the event took place, but is in a classified regime, which does not allow a spokesperson to say anything specific.</seg>
<seg id="12">Bárta’s lawyer, Oldřich Chudoba, is in a similar situation.</seg>
<seg id="13">He told the media that he is representing Bárta "in this matter as well", but due to the fact it is classified information, he cannot confirm or deny Bárta’s arrest.</seg>
<seg id="14">Some media speculated earlier that Bárta’s arrest could be connected to the former chief of police Petr Lessy.</seg>
<seg id="15">It was Bárta and former Public Affairs chairman Radek John, who headed the Ministry of the Interior, who put him in the post.</seg>
<seg id="16">The dispute which erupted because of this between former prime minister Petr Nečas and Public Affairs had to be dealt with by the president at the time, Václav Klaus.</seg>
<seg id="17">I don’t know where this connection to me came from.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nobody contacted me, I wasn’t questioned.</seg>
<seg id="19">"I really know nothing about the matter," Lessy told iDNES.cz.</seg>
<seg id="20">In January 2011, Lessy became the chief of police.</seg>
<seg id="21">Though officially Radek John pulled the strings to get him there, the true head of the party at the time was Bárta.</seg>
<seg id="22">Bárta was a candidate in the election for the Dawn movement, but he just missed out on a parliamentary mandate – by 175 votes.</seg>
<seg id="23">Dawn’s leader, Tomio Okamura, declared that he had no idea what it was about.</seg>
<seg id="24">"Vít Bárta was one of many candidates from many parties on our list of candidates, and as I said repeatedly before the election, he was not and is not a member of Tomio Okamura's Dawn of Direct Democracy," said Okamura, distancing himself from Bárta, having said before the election that he gave Bárta space to be a Dawn candidate because he helped him to fix a problem with executors.</seg>
<seg id="25">Vít Bárta found himself in court in 2012 with his former party colleague from Public Affairs, Jaroslav Škárka.</seg>

<seg id="1">Aircraft electronic device rules to stay in force in Australia for now</seg>
<seg id="2">Australian airline passengers will need to continue turning off their tablets and smart phones during take-off and landing despite moves in the US to loosen regulations covering the devices.</seg>
<seg id="3">The US Federal Aviation Administration has left the way open for American carriers to change their procedures so that passengers will be able to read e-books, watch videos or play games on their devices during critical phases of flight provided they remain in "airplane" mode.</seg>
<seg id="4">Passengers can already do this during the bulk of a flight but many people find it annoying to be unable to access their e-books during take-offs and landings.</seg>
<seg id="5">Australian carriers are looking at the decision, which requires US carriers to undertake a massive amount of work to meet the requirements, but have indicated they have no immediate plans to change their procedures.</seg>
<seg id="6">The Civil Aviation Safety Authority also said it was looking at the announcement but emphasised that restrictions on the use of electronic devices in critical phases of flight were still in place in Australia.</seg>
<seg id="7">"CASA currently has no specific regulations governing the use of electronic devices in aircraft," it said.</seg>
<seg id="8">The issue is covered by regulations which require aircraft operators to ensure safety is maintained at all times and passengers to comply with the safety instructions given by crew members.</seg>
<seg id="9">Virgin, which has already been talking to CASA about extending the use its in-flight wi-fi entertainment system, was amenable to a change but said it would take its lead from the regulator.</seg>
<seg id="10">"We would welcome a review by CASA into allowing the use of electronic devices because we really do think it will improve the customer experience now that we have (wireless in-flight entertainment) on our planes," a spokesman said.</seg>
<seg id="11">Qantas said it would stick with the current rules for now.</seg>
<seg id="12">"Our current policy is that electronic devices cannot be used during take-off and landing and we have no immediate plans to change that," it said.</seg>
<seg id="13">The FAA ruling applies to American airlines.</seg>
<seg id="14">However, we are always interested in regulatory developments that could benefit passengers and we will certainly be taking a close look at the FAA's decision and the reasons behind it.</seg>
<seg id="15">For US carriers, the impact of the ruling will vary from airline to airline and will depend on the age of their fleet.</seg>
<seg id="16">Carriers will need to prove their planes can tolerate radio interference from mobile devices as well as revise manuals, training materials, carry-on baggage programs and passenger briefings.</seg>
<seg id="17">"Once an airline verifies the tolerance of its fleet, it can allow passengers to use handheld, lightweight electronic devices such as tablets, e-readers, and smartphones-at all altitudes," the FAA said.</seg>
<seg id="18">In rare instances of low visibility, the crew will instruct passengers to turn off their devices during landing.</seg>
<seg id="19">The group also recommended that heavier devices should be safely stowed under seats or in overhead bins during take-off and landing.</seg>

<seg id="1">Pawnbrokers shine in Singapore as middle class feel the pinch</seg>
<seg id="2">At a pawnshop in Bendemeer shopping centre in Singapore, Janani Amirthalinga is swapping a gold bangle, ring and pair of earrings to pay her daughters" school fees.</seg>
<seg id="3">"My husband and I have just bought a house so all my money's stuck there," Mrs Amirthalinga says.</seg>
<seg id="4">Even though she earns S$3,000 ($2,400) a month as an administrator and her husband works as well, the monthly family income is insufficient, she says.</seg>
<seg id="5">Indeed, such is demand across parts of southeast Asia - where household debt is rising - that ValueMax, where she is carrying out her transaction, this week became the third pawnshop to list on the Singapore stock exchange.</seg>
<seg id="6">Pawning jewellery is not merely a fast way to land cash - S$1,300 in Ms Amirthalinga's case - but almost as cheap as unsecured bank loans.</seg>
<seg id="7">Typically pawnbrokers in Singapore charge an effective annual percentage rate of 17 per cent, just above the 15.4 per cent offered at United Overseas Bank, a local lender with a branch in the same shopping centre.</seg>
<seg id="8">However, pawnbrokers have the advantage of not requiring credit checks or proof of salary, and can arrange loans faster than banks.</seg>
<seg id="9">Hence millions of people across the region are turning to pawnshops as families feel the squeeze from rising living costs and ballooning household and consumer debt.</seg>
<seg id="10">After five years of robust growth since the global financial crisis, and cheap credit fuelled by loose monetary policy in advanced economies, lower- and middle-income families are turning to pawn shops to make up the difference as their economies slow.</seg>
<seg id="11">This week Standard & Poor's, the rating agency, cited increasing household leverage, mainly from rising mortgages, as a risk factor for Asian banks" creditworthiness.</seg>
<seg id="12">It said that Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore had the highest household debt to gross domestic product ratios in Asia.</seg>
<seg id="13">Malaysia topped the list at 80 per cent of GDP, up from 60 per cent in 2008.</seg>
<seg id="14">Economists are also worried about high levels of consumer debt in Thailand, which this week narrowly emerged from technical recession.</seg>
<seg id="15">On Thursday, data showed continued export weakness, and a softening in consumer demand.</seg>
<seg id="16">"Bottom line is that with costs rising, people in the middle to lower end [of the income scale] will be looking to supplement their income wherever they can," says Song Seng Wun, economist at CIMB, a Malaysian bank.</seg>
<seg id="17">Historically high prices for gold in the past two years have added to the rush to pawn personal belongings, as people take the opportunity to cash in the value of their family jewellery.</seg>
<seg id="18">In Singapore, about 70 per cent of items pawned at the city-state's 200 pawn outlets are gold.</seg>
<seg id="19">People are saying "the gold price looks good, let's pawn grandma's gold chain and get it back next month.</seg>
<seg id="20">In Thailand the largest pawnshop operator, EasyMoney, has seen an up to 20 per cent rise in the number of customers using its outlets in recent months.</seg>
<seg id="21">Such is the growth in the pawn business that ValueMax, operator of the outlet at Bendemeer and of 15 others like it in Singapore, plans to expand not only in neighbouring Malaysia - where it has four shops - but outside Asia too, says Yeah Lee Ching, ValueMax's executive director.</seg>
<seg id="22">The company will fund that by using 60 per cent of S$66m it raised this week in a listing on the Singapore stock exchange.</seg>
<seg id="23">While some discount lenders have come under fire for high interest rates, Ms Yeah says that not only does pawning offer cheaper rates than other lenders, it also does not add directly to debt.</seg>
<seg id="24">"Customers are mortgaging items that they already own, and monetising personal assets does not increase household debt," she says.</seg>
<seg id="25">There's an increased social acceptance of pawnbroking as a means to secure short term, secured financing.</seg>
<seg id="26">Nor are the types of people who use pawnbrokers only the financially stretched.</seg>
<seg id="27">Wealthy people in Singapore also use ValueMax outlets, pawning gold bars or Rolex watches, which can command up to 60 per cent of their purchase price in cash.</seg>
<seg id="28">We see customers from all walks of life.</seg>
<seg id="29">"They include wealthy individuals who need to borrow short term for business ventures or investments, or small businesses with a need to tide over their cash flow needs," says Ms Yeah.</seg>
<seg id="30">Sometimes they just need the money very quickly.</seg>

<seg id="3">Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek has announced the Commonwealth is taking "urgent action" to head off a crisis caused by the island state's aging population, higher rates of chronic disease and system constraints.</seg>
<seg id="4">The funding, over four years, was decided after government consultations with Tasmanian independent MP Andrew Wilkie.</seg>
<seg id="5">"The Government has come up with an emergency rescue package we believe will address the unique challenges faced by the state," Ms Plibersek said today.</seg>
<seg id="6">The $325 million package includes a $31 million elective surgery blitz.</seg>
<seg id="7">An additional 2600 operations including orthopedic and cataract surgery will help clear a backlog.</seg>
<seg id="8">There's also money for walk-in clinics in Hobart and Launceston, better after-hospital care, medical specialist training, mental health services and the rollout of personal electronic health record systems in local hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="9">"These investments respond to the ideas that front-line clinicians have told me will be the best ways to tend to Tasmania's health system," Ms Plibersek said.</seg>
<seg id="10">The minister insisted the Tasmanian Government would face a strict reporting and accountability regime.</seg>
<seg id="11">The state would have to maintain current funding levels in order to receive Commonwealth cash and report monthly on where it was spending the extra funds.</seg>
<seg id="12">A three-person commission will be set up to ensure the state is delivering services as effectively and efficiently as possible.</seg>
<seg id="13">Mr Wilkie today said the $325 million would count for little "unless it's followed by genuine reform to put Tasmania's public health system on a more sustainable footing."</seg>
<seg id="14">He nevertheless praised the Government for responding to his request for urgent assistance which he first raised with the Prime Minister at the beginning of May.</seg>
<seg id="15">"I'm hopeful the federal assistance package will go a long way towards taking the state's public health system off the critical list," Mr Wilkie said.</seg>
<seg id="16">According to the State Government these additional elective procedures will largely reverse the recent cuts.</seg>
<seg id="17">But federal Opposition health spokesman Peter Dutton believes today's announcement is a "band-aid solution."</seg>
<seg id="18">"The reason we are here is that the Labor State Government ripped $430 million out of its health system," he told ABC TV.</seg>
<seg id="19">You can't have a state government ripping out almost half-a-billion dollars and the Commonwealth put in $300 million and pretend it's a good news day.</seg>
<seg id="20">Mr Dutton called on Ms Plibersek to guarantee that not one dollar out of the rescue package would be spent on additional bureaucracy.</seg>

<seg id="1">Syria has destroyed its chemical weapons making ability, watchdog group says</seg>
<seg id="2">Syria has destroyed critical equipment for producing chemical weapons and poison gas munitions, the global chemical weapons watchdog said Thursday as fierce clashes raged in the country's north, close to one of the sites where toxic agents are believed to be stored.</seg>
<seg id="3">Also Thursday, a Syrian activist group said more than 120,000 people have been killed since the start of the country's civil war nearly three years ago.</seg>
<seg id="4">The announcement by the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons came one day ahead of the Nov.</seg>
<seg id="5">1 deadline set by The Hague-based organization for Damascus to destroy or "render inoperable" all chemical weapon production facilities and machinery for mixing chemicals into poison gas and filling munitions.</seg>
<seg id="6">The completion of what is essentially the initial stage of destruction is a significant milestone in an ambitious timeline that aims to destroy all of Damascus' chemical weapons by mid-2014.</seg>
<seg id="7">Destruction of the equipment means that Syria can no longer produce new chemical weapons.</seg>
<seg id="8">However, Damascus still has to start destroying existing weapons and stockpiles.</seg>
<seg id="9">The country is believed to have around 1,000 metric tons of chemicals and weapons including mustard gas and the nerve agent sarin.</seg>
<seg id="10">The announcement came as fighting raged Thursday in the town of Safira, which experts say is home to a chemical weapons production facility as well as storage sites, reported the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.</seg>
<seg id="11">The activist group, which has been tracking the death toll through a network of activists in Syria, said Thursday that 120,296 people have died.</seg>
<seg id="12">Of those, it said 61,067 are civilians, including 6,365 children.</seg>
<seg id="13">On the government side, it said 29,954 are members of President Bashar Assad's armed forces, 18,678 are pro-government fighters and 187 are Lebanese Hezbollah militants.</seg>
<seg id="14">Also among the dead it said were 2,202 army defectors and some 5,375 opposition fighters, many of them foreigners.</seg>
<seg id="15">On July 25, the U.N. estimated 100,000 have died in the conflict since March 2011.</seg>
<seg id="16">It has not updated that figure since.</seg>
<seg id="17">The conflict has forced some 2 million people to flee the country.</seg>
<seg id="18">Assad's troops have been battling rebels, many of them linked to al-Qaida groups, in Safira for weeks.</seg>
<seg id="19">The Observatory said there were casualties on both sides Thursday but had no specifics.</seg>
<seg id="20">The fighting underscored the dangers the chemical weapons' inspectors face as they race against tight deadlines in their mission to rid Syria of the toxic arsenal in the midst of an ongoing civil war.</seg>
<seg id="21">A statement from the OPCW, which works closely with the United Nations, said its team was "now satisfied that it has verified - and seen destroyed - all of Syria's declared critical production and mixing/filling equipment."</seg>
<seg id="22">It added that, "no further inspection activities are currently planned."</seg>
<seg id="23">Earlier this week, the inspectors said they had completed their first round of verification work, visiting 21 of 23 sites declared by Damascus.</seg>
<seg id="24">They were unable to visit two sites because of security concerns, the inspectors said.</seg>
<seg id="25">On Thursday, OPCW said the two locations were, according to Syria, "abandoned and ... the chemical weapons program items they contained were moved to other declared sites, which were inspected."</seg>
<seg id="26">It was not immediately clear if the facility in Safira was one of the two sites that OPCW inspectors were not able to visit.</seg>
<seg id="27">Syria has submitted a plan for the total destruction of its chemical weapons that has to be approved next month by the OPCW's executive committee.</seg>
<seg id="28">"I salute the fortitude and courage you've all demonstrated in fulfilling the most challenging mission ever undertaken by this organization," the watchdog's director-general, Ahmet Uzumcu, said in comments released by the OPCW.</seg>
<seg id="29">Now in its third year, the civil war pits the primarily Sunni Muslim rebels against Assad's government and its security forces, which are stacked with members of his Alawite sect, an offshoot of Shiite Islam.</seg>
<seg id="30">In other developments, the Observatory's chief Rami Abdurrahman said there had been a strong explosion Wednesday inside an air defense facility in Syria's coastal province of Latakia.</seg>
<seg id="31">The cause of the blast was not known, he said.</seg>

<seg id="1">Anger over Bali bomb plotter's sentence</seg>
<seg id="2">Survivors and relatives of the 202 people killed in the 2002 Bali bombing have reacted with anger over the sentence given to the last of the plotters to face justice, saying Umar Patek should face a firing squad.</seg>
<seg id="3">Patek, who spent almost 10 years on the run as one of South-East Asia's most wanted, was yesterday sentenced to 20 years in jail for his role in building the explosive devices used in the bombing.</seg>
<seg id="4">He could be released within 15 years if granted parole.</seg>
<seg id="5">The 45-year-old was found guilty of mass murder for the attack on two nightclubs in the popular tourist area of Kuta which left 202 people dead, including 88 Australians, and injured scores more.</seg>
<seg id="6">He was also found guilty of a number of other terrorism-related charges, including a wave of bombings of churches across Indonesia on Christmas Eve in 2000.</seg>
<seg id="7">Prosecutors had demanded a life sentence, although they could have pushed that the man dubbed the "Demolition Man" for his reputation as a master bomb-maker be sentenced to death.</seg>
<seg id="8">The decision has reignited painful memories for Perth mother June Corteen, who lost her 39-year-old twin daughters Jane and Jenny in the destruction unleashed by Patek and his co-conspirators almost a decade ago.</seg>
<seg id="9">Fighting back tears, she said Patek should have been sentenced to death.</seg>
<seg id="10">I really feel that he should follow in the footsteps of the other guys.</seg>
<seg id="11">"He should be put in front of the firing squad," Ms Corteen told AAP.</seg>
<seg id="12">I have to live every day without seeing more grandchildren, and my daughters.</seg>
<seg id="13">The Sari Club was levelled when a massive bomb loaded into a van parked outside was detonated just after 11pm on October 12, 2002.</seg>
<seg id="14">Peter Hughes was in Paddy's Bar where a suicide bomber detonated a backpack loaded with explosives just 20 seconds earlier.</seg>
<seg id="15">He lapsed into a month-long coma in the wake of the bombing, and "died" three times while on life support.</seg>
<seg id="16">Mr Hughes said Patek should have shared the same fate as three other members of the Jemaah Islamiah terror cell responsible for the carnage - Amrozi, Mukhlas and Imam Samudra - who were executed four years ago.</seg>
<seg id="17">Really, this guy should get the death penalty before anybody.</seg>
<seg id="18">To keep him alive, well, there's no reason to keep him alive.</seg>
<seg id="19">To get 20 years, after killing 202 people and injuring many hundreds, it's not much.</seg>
<seg id="20">Patek is the last of the Bali bombers to face justice.</seg>
<seg id="21">He had avoided capture for almost a decade but was eventually apprehended in January 2011 in the Pakistani town of Abbottabad, where US forces killed former al-Qaeda chief Osama bin Laden less than four months later.</seg>
<seg id="22">During the trial, an FBI agent testified that intelligence reports had revealed Patek was in Pakistan to meet with bin Laden in an effort to re-establish links between South-East Asian terrorist groups and al-Qaeda.</seg>
<seg id="23">"He didn't give himself up," Ms Corteen said.</seg>
<seg id="24">Until just recently, he really didn't feel sorry for how much grief he caused other people.</seg>
<seg id="25">The verdict comes ahead of the 10th anniversary of the attack later this year, which will be marked by ceremonies in Bali and Australia.</seg>
<seg id="26">"There will be a lot of tears this year," Ms Corteen said.</seg>
<seg id="27">Patek may yet appeal his sentence.</seg>

<seg id="1">FAA: Air passengers can now use gadgets on planes (but not make cell phone calls)</seg>
<seg id="2">Airline passengers will be able to use their electronic devices gate-to-gate to read, work, play games, watch movies and listen to music - but not talk on their cellphones - under much-anticipated new guidelines issued Thursday by the Federal Aviation Administration.</seg>
<seg id="3">But passengers shouldn't expect changes to happen immediately.</seg>
<seg id="4">How fast the change is implemented will vary by the airline, FAA Administrator Michael Huerta said at a news conference.</seg>
<seg id="5">Airlines will have to show the FAA how their airplanes meet the new guidelines and that they've updating their flight crew training manuals and rules for stowing devices to reflect the new guidelines.</seg>
<seg id="6">The FAA said it has already received plans from some airlines to expand the use of portable electronic devices on planes.</seg>
<seg id="7">Delta and JetBlue were among the airliners who have already submitted plans.</seg>
<seg id="8">"Depending on the condition of the plan, we could approve expanded use of electronic devices very soon," the FAA said in a statement.</seg>
<seg id="9">Currently, passengers are required to turn off their smartphones, tablets and other devices once a plane's door closes.</seg>
<seg id="10">They're not supposed to restart them until the planes reach 10,000 feet and the captain gives the go-ahead.</seg>
<seg id="11">Passengers are supposed to turn their devices off again as the plane descends to land and not restart them until the plane is on the ground.</seg>
<seg id="12">Under the new guidelines, airlines whose planes are properly protected from electronic interference may allow passengers to use the devices during takeoffs, landings and taxiing, the FAA said.</seg>
<seg id="13">Most new airliners and other planes that have been modified so that passengers can use Wifi at higher altitudes are expected to meet the criteria.</seg>
<seg id="14">Laura Glading, president of the Association of Professional Flight Attendants, welcomed the changes.</seg>
<seg id="15">"Once the new policy is safely implemented - and we're going to work closely with the carrier to do that - it will be a win-win," Glading said in a statement.</seg>
<seg id="16">We're frankly tired of feeling like 'hall monitors' when it comes to this issue.</seg>
<seg id="17">But connecting to the Internet to surf, exchange emails, text or download data will still be prohibited below 10,000 feet, the agency said.</seg>
<seg id="18">Passengers will be told to switch their smartphones, tablets and other devices to airplane mode.</seg>
<seg id="19">So, still no Words With Friends, the online Scrabble-type game that actor Alec Baldwin was playing on his smartphone in 2011 when he was famously booted off an American Airlines jet for refusing to turn off the device while the plane was parked at the gate.</seg>
<seg id="20">And heavier devices such as laptops will continue to have to be stowed because of concern they might injure someone if they go flying around the cabin.</seg>
<seg id="21">In-flight cellphone calls also will continue to be prohibited.</seg>
<seg id="22">Regulatory authority over phone calls belongs to the Federal Communications Commission, not the FAA.</seg>
<seg id="23">FAA may lift ban on some electronic devices during takeoff and landing</seg>
<seg id="24">Last month, National Transportation Safety Board Mark Rosenker, a CBS News national transportation safety expert, said that cell phones are still considered a risk.</seg>
<seg id="25">"Cell phones, that really is an issue, not just because potentially it could create interference with navigational devices, but we do know, according to the FCC, that it could interfere with cell phone towers when they're in the air," Rosenker said.</seg>
<seg id="26">An industry advisory committee created by the FAA to examine the issue recommended last month that the government permit greater use of personal electronic devices.</seg>
<seg id="27">Pressure has been building on the FAA in recent years to ease restrictions on their use.</seg>
<seg id="28">Critics such as Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., contend there is no valid safety reason for the prohibitions.</seg>
<seg id="29">The restrictions have also become increasingly difficult to enforce as use of the devices has become ubiquitous.</seg>
<seg id="30">Some studies indicate as many as a third of passengers forget or ignore directions to turn off their devices.</seg>
<seg id="31">The FAA began restricting passengers' use of electronic devices in 1966 in response to reports of interference with navigation and communications equipment when passengers began carrying FM radios, the high-tech gadgets of their day.</seg>
<seg id="32">New airliners are far more reliant on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft, but they are also designed and approved by the FAA to be resistant to electronic interference.</seg>
<seg id="33">Airlines have been offering Wi-Fi use at cruising altitudes to passengers for several years.</seg>
<seg id="34">Planes modified for Wi-Fi systems are also more resistant to interference.</seg>
<seg id="35">The vast majority of airliners should qualify for greater electronic device use under the new guidelines, Huerta said.</seg>
<seg id="36">Today's electronic devices generally emit much lower power radio transmissions than previous generations of devices.</seg>
<seg id="37">E-readers, for example, emit only minimal transmissions when turning a page.</seg>
<seg id="38">But transmissions are stronger when devices are downloading or sending data.</seg>
<seg id="39">Among those pressing for a relaxation of restrictions on passengers' use of the devices has been Amazon.com.</seg>
<seg id="40">In 2011, company officials loaded an airliner full of their Kindle e-readers and flew it around to test for problems but found none.</seg>
<seg id="41">FAA advisory committee members expressed mixed feelings about whether use of the devices presents any risk.</seg>
<seg id="42">Douglas Kidd of the National Association of Airline Passengers said he believes interference from the devices is genuine even if the risk is minimal.</seg>
<seg id="43">Other committee members said there are only anecdotal reports from pilots to support that the devices can interfere with aircraft systems, and most of those reports are very old.</seg>
<seg id="44">However, the committee recommended the FAA allow pilots to order passengers to shut off devices during instrument landings in low visibility.</seg>
<seg id="45">A travel industry group welcomed the changes, calling them common-sense accommodations for a traveling public now bristling with technology.</seg>
<seg id="46">"We're pleased the FAA recognizes that an enjoyable passenger experience is not incompatible with safety and security," said Roger Dow, CEO of the U.S. Travel Association.</seg>

<seg id="1">Is Europe's elite ready to do business with Britain?</seg>
<seg id="2">Business for Britain launched in April with a pledge to bring business together and define what the UK's wealth and job creators want to see changed in our relationship with the EU.</seg>
<seg id="3">To that end, we commissioned the largest and most comprehensive poll of British business leaders asking them for their thoughts on Britain, business and the EU.</seg>
<seg id="4">YouGov polled over 1,000 business leaders, broadly representative of Britain's business sizes, sectors and regions.</seg>
<seg id="5">The conclusions of the poll will come as a surprise to many.</seg>
<seg id="6">We found that the vast majority of businesses are now looking to export outside of Europe, focusing on countries that are modernising and growing while the EU states stagnate.</seg>
<seg id="7">They want to see the Government prioritise new trading links with the likes of China, India and Brazil, rather than getting bogged down in the long and arduous process of reforming the EU's arcane institutions.</seg>
<seg id="8">When asked their views on specific policy areas - ranging from monopoly regulation to product laws - the majority of business leaders thought that control of these key competences should be returned to Westminster.</seg>
<seg id="9">There was general discontent with the Single Market, with businesses saying that the costs of Brussels regulation now outweighed the benefits of being part of Europe's trading area - even 40 per cent of large businesses, traditionally the most pro-European of companies, agreed.</seg>
<seg id="10">Finally, and most tellingly of all, our poll of business leaders found a clear majority wanted to see Britain pursue a course of treaty change and a relationship with the EU that is based on trade, not politics.</seg>
<seg id="11">This finding, which was reflected across the sizes and major business groups, shows that business is pushing for a "meaningful change" that brings powers back to the UK.</seg>
<seg id="12">The stakes are high - achieving treaty change and a better deal for Britain sees a 16 per cent swing towards voting to stay in the EU in a referendum.</seg>
<seg id="13">The Prime Minister should be in no doubt: this poll shows that British business backs his plan for renegotiating the terms of Britain's membership of the EU.</seg>
<seg id="14">It also shows that business expects that renegotiation to make a significant shift in the current balance of power back towards the UK.</seg>
<seg id="15">A better deal for British business is possible, and increasingly necessary as the eurozone embarks on the road to closer economic and fiscal union.</seg>
<seg id="16">The priority must be jobs and growth in Britain and, as the findings of our poll show, for business this means a renewed focus on trade and a fundamental change in Brussels" regulatory approach.</seg>

<seg id="1">John Kerry admits: Spying has gone too far!</seg>
<seg id="2">The United States have sometimes gone "too far", admitted John Kerry, chief of American diplomacy, according to the AFP agency, in a video conference between Washington and London.</seg>
<seg id="3">Gathering information, however, according to the minister, has served to prevent terrorist attacks.</seg>
<seg id="4">The "first admission from Washington" according to AFP was made in the middle of intense controversy on both sides of the Atlantic due to the scandalous revelations about mass data monitoring by America’s National Security Agency (NSA), with US allies also becoming a target.</seg>
<seg id="5">"In some cases, I acknowledge, as has the President (Barack Obama), that some of these actions have gone too far and we are going to make sure that that doesn’t happen in the future," said Kerry.</seg>
<seg id="6">In the interview, however, he mostly defended current practice.</seg>
<seg id="7">Data gathering is in his opinion necessary in the fight against terrorism and preventing attacks such as the attacks on 11 September 2001 in the USA, the attacks in Madrid in March 2004 and in London in July 2005.</seg>
<seg id="8">"We have prevented aeroplanes from going down, buildings from being blown up, people from being assassinated because we've been able to learn ahead of time of the plans," emphasised Kerry.</seg>
<seg id="9">Nevertheless, he again admitted that data gathering "in some cases have gone too far."</seg>
<seg id="10">The scandal around US intelligence, which allegedly monitored hundreds of millions of telephone calls, broke out in Europe this month.</seg>
<seg id="11">Amongst other things, it showed that the Americans even monitored the mobile phone of German Chancellor Angela Merkel.</seg>
<seg id="12">European leaders did not hide their indignation and some of them called on the European Union to try and reach an agreement with the United States which would prohibit or significantly restrict the monitoring.</seg>

<seg id="2">The start of construction of the South Stream gas pipeline in Bulgaria marks the launch of one of Europe's largest energy projects, Gazprom's chief said.</seg>
<seg id="3">"A landmark event has taken place today: Construction started on the Bulgarian section of the South Stream gas pipeline, the most large-scale and important project in Europe," Gazprom Chairman Alexei Miller said in a statement Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="4">This project is a key element of energy security of the whole European continent.</seg>

<seg id="2">A decisive battle awaits.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Lebanese Hezbollah movement has deployed 15,000 fighters north of Damascus in preparation for a decisive battle for the mountainous region of Qalamoun.</seg>
<seg id="4">According to reports which are still being clarified, Israel destroyed missiles intended for Hezbollah in Wednesday’s raids on two sites in western Syria.</seg>
<seg id="5">The Lebanese Shiite organisation is fighting in Syria on the side of its army.</seg>
<seg id="6">Its programme is also the fight against Israel, which is not interfering in the Syrian conflict, but has clearly said that it will prevent the transport of weapons to the hands of Hezbollah in Lebanon.</seg>
<seg id="7">Reports on Wednesday’s Israeli strikes on weapons stores in western Syria are still being clarified.</seg>
<seg id="8">Israel has not commented on the attack, but it has been confirmed by American sources.</seg>
<seg id="9">According to the Syrian website Dampress.com missiles fired from the Mediterranean Sea area hit a Syrian missile base at Snubar Jableh south of Latakia.</seg>
<seg id="10">News channel al-Arabiya says that two stores were hit, in which there were missiles prepared for transport to Lebanon.</seg>
<seg id="11">According to their sources, they were Russian manufactured SA-8 missiles.</seg>
<seg id="12">Israel refused to comment on the news, but military analyst Ron Ben-Yishai said that Syria is constantly trying to arm Hezbollah with missiles and the Syrian Air Force is teaching members of the armed section of Hezbollah to operate the missiles.</seg>
<seg id="13">The SA-8 is an outdated missile the Syrian Army has had since the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="14">They are placed on a moving chassis.</seg>
<seg id="15">Although they are quite primitive, thanks to their mobility and small dimensions, they can be easily hidden.</seg>
<seg id="16">They are equipped with a radar which switches off after the missile is fired, so it is hard to aim them.</seg>
<seg id="17">Latakia is situated in western Syria, in an area inhabited by the ruling Alawites.</seg>
<seg id="18">It is a well-guarded area and Hezbollah has in the past taken part in battles in western Syria.</seg>
<seg id="19">They say they are helping to protect the Syrian Shiite community, to which the Alawites belong.</seg>
<seg id="20">Now reportedly 15,000 of their fighters are prepared to help the army recapture Qalamoun.</seg>
<seg id="21">Together with Hezbollah there, the Syrian Army is also reinforcing its troops.</seg>
<seg id="22">Qalamoun lies between Damascus and the third largest city in the country, Homs.</seg>
<seg id="23">According to an al-Arabiya source, the battle is meant to be a revenge for the recent attack of the opposition on the headquarters of the Syrian Shiite Abu al-Abbas Brigade in the Shiite part of Damascus.</seg>

<seg id="1">Two YMCA employees charged with sex offences before allegations against Jonathan Lord, Royal Commission hears</seg>
<seg id="2">Two YMCA NSW employees had been charged with child sex offences before allegations were raised against Caringbah child care worker Jonathan Lord in 2011, the child sexual abuse Royal Commission has heard.</seg>
<seg id="3">But in its opening statement to the Commission it said it had "never dealt with an incident of child sexual assault within its organisation," the Commission was told.</seg>
<seg id="4">Chief executive officer Phillip Hare was asked about one case where a YMCA employee was charged child pornography offences, and another when a gym instructor at the YMCA Caringbah Hall was convicted of child sexual offences against children in his care in 1991.</seg>
<seg id="5">Mr Hare told Gail Furness, counsel assisting the Commission, he knew about the first case but did not know about the second one.</seg>
<seg id="6">He conceded the YMCA's opening statement to the commission was also inaccurate in claiming "there have been external audits of the YMCA that have recognised the YMCA as being at the forefront of child safety."</seg>
<seg id="7">Evidence before the commission is that YMCA was notified that it received the second lowest of four possible ratings in a Department of Education and Communities quality audit in August this year.</seg>
<seg id="8">Mr Hare, who started with the YMCA when he was 21, conceded management "from myself down" failed by recruiting Lord and failed to make sure staff were clear about their obligations to report child safe policy breaches.</seg>
<seg id="9">Earlier this year Lord was convicted for sexual offences against 12 boys during the two years he worked at the YMCA.</seg>
<seg id="10">He was jailed for a minimum of six years.</seg>
<seg id="11">But Mr Hare rejected the suggestion the YMCA had a cultural problem which prevented staff from reporting Lord's breaches of child safety.</seg>
<seg id="12">Staff gave evidence they observed breaches including Lord being alone with children, babysitting them privately, having them sit on his lap, saying he loved one and letting them play with his mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="13">Danielle Ockwell, who was supervised by Lord and asked for child protection training because she was concerned about his behaviour, testified she found the YMCA Caringbah children's services manager Jacqui Barnat who supervised Lord "very intimidating and hard to approach a lot of the time."</seg>
<seg id="14">The CEO said he did not accept staff's evidence that they were uncomfortable with reporting upwards to their managers.</seg>
<seg id="15">Rather, he said, their friendships with Lord clouded their judgements about reporting him.</seg>
<seg id="16">Mr Hare said he had provided his view to the YMCA NSW board that the lesson for the organisation from the "Jonathan Lord incident" was "not about reporting" by staff, and the board agreed with him.</seg>
<seg id="17">Mr Hare said the decision to get staff to sign confidentiality agreements soon after the allegations emerged was made by YMCA general manager of children's services Liam Whitley.</seg>
<seg id="18">He said it was intended to avoid contamination of evidence but was "overzealous" and poorly executed.</seg>
<seg id="19">YMCA NSW was not a child safe organisation at the time Jonathan Lord was employed between 2009 and 2011, child sex abuse expert Professor Stephen Smallbone of Griffith University told the commission.</seg>
<seg id="20">He said there were "serious problems" in recruitment, screening, induction, training and supervision of staff.</seg>
<seg id="21">The hearing adjourned until December 20.</seg>

<seg id="1">As crowds of horse-showing experts gathered in Cardiff to battle it out for Horse of the Year, they knew the competition would be tough.</seg>
<seg id="2">But nobody was quite ready for three-year-old Fenton Kirkland.</seg>
<seg id="3">Not yet in school and just months on from taking his first steps, the toddler and his pet Shetland pony Toffee trotted through the three rounds with ease to take the top prize - leaving their 30 adult opponents trailing behind.</seg>
<seg id="4">The inseparable pair - who are the same height - were commended for appearance, behaviour and style at the annual contest run by Sunnybank Equestrian Centre, in Rudry near Cardiff.</seg>
<seg id="5">Taking to the stage against men and women in smart bowler hats, he tipped his flat cap at a jaunty angle and paraded two-year-old Toffee around the ring.</seg>
<seg id="6">Fenton was lauded by judges for natural handling skills well beyond his years.</seg>
<seg id="7">And Toffee received top marks for his appearance and personality.</seg>
<seg id="8">Fenton was given Toffee as a third birthday present last March and has practised with the Shetland pony every day since.</seg>
<seg id="9">His mother Donna, 30, said: "Fenton and Toffee are a great double act."</seg>
<seg id="10">They were up against all comers but the two of them walked off with the gold cup and rosette.</seg>
<seg id="11">It was only the second time he had competed with Toffee and we were all ecstatic when he won.</seg>
<seg id="12">Complete strangers in the arena all thought he was so phenomenal they wanted photos taken with him.</seg>
<seg id="13">The youngster, from the village of Nantyglo, near Ebbw Vale, South Wales, is following in the footsteps of his aunt Sharon Howells, who has been showing horses for more than 10 years.</seg>
<seg id="14">Mrs Howells said: "The whole place was electric and everybody was cheering and clapping."</seg>
<seg id="15">He was running on sand down the full length of the arena and even though he looked so tiny he did a marvellous job.</seg>
<seg id="16">Fenton is animal mad - he loves horses, tractors and farms and has got two chickens which he looks after.</seg>
<seg id="17">The way he has started he'll be at the Horse of the Year show before long - and I'm sure he'll do well.</seg>
<seg id="18">A spokesman for the annual horse show said: "Fenton is only three but he knows how to handle his pony."</seg>
<seg id="19">They are a great team together.</seg>
<seg id="20">The judges marked Fenton and Toffee on how well they were turned out and the way they presented in the show ring.</seg>
<seg id="21">They look for good teamwork between the pony and the handler - Fenton and Toffee were the best in the ring.</seg>
<seg id="22">I'm sure Fenton was helped by his cute clothes, he really looked the part.</seg>

<seg id="1">China plea paper 'to be overhauled'</seg>
<seg id="2">A Chinese newspaper that made a front-page appeal for the release of a reporter accused of defamation is to be overhauled, a press regulator says.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Guangzhou-based New Express made a rare public plea for the release of journalist Chen Yongzhou.</seg>
<seg id="4">But Mr Chen subsequently admitted on television that he had taken bribes to fabricate stories about a part state-owned company.</seg>
<seg id="5">Now the New Express is to undergo "full rectification," the regulator said.</seg>
<seg id="6">The "rectification" order came from the Guangdong Administration of Press and Publication, Radio, Film and Television.</seg>
<seg id="7">A preliminary investigation showed that Yangcheng Evening News Group's New Express had published several untrue reports about listed company Zoomlion in the period of September 2012 to August 2013.</seg>
<seg id="8">"New Express's editorial management was disordered," the regulator said in a statement.</seg>
<seg id="9">It said it had decided to "impose an administrative penalty on Chen Yongzhou by revoking his reporter's license."</seg>
<seg id="10">It had also "instructed Yangcheng Evening News Group to undertake a complete rectification of New Express, and recommended they investigate the relevant responsible persons at New Express and immediately revise New Express's leadership team."</seg>
<seg id="11">Mr Chen wrote several articles for the New Express alleging financial irregularities at a construction-equipment company called Zoomlion.</seg>
<seg id="12">After he was detained, his newspaper published two front-page appeals for his release, saying it backed his journalism.</seg>
<seg id="13">But Mr Chen then appeared on state television admitting he had published false stories for money.</seg>
<seg id="14">"In this case I've caused damages to Zoomlion and also the whole news media industry and its ability to earn the public's trust," he told state broadcaster CCTV.</seg>
<seg id="15">I did this mainly because I hankered after money and fame.</seg>
<seg id="16">I've realised my wrongdoing.</seg>
<seg id="17">Following Mr Chen's apology, New Express issued a front-page apology, saying it had failed to properly check his reports.</seg>
<seg id="18">Several high-profile suspects have made televised confessions recently.</seg>
<seg id="19">Experts say confessions are still routinely coerced, despite a change in the law earlier this year banning the authorities from forcing anyone to incriminate themselves.</seg>

<seg id="2">One of the most sophisticated drug smuggling tunnels between the USA and Mexico has been found, complete with its own lighting, ventilation and electric rail systems.</seg>
<seg id="3">US authorities described the four foot by three foot tunnel as one of the most sophisticated secret passages they have ever discovered.</seg>
<seg id="4">The tunnel, which zigzags the length of nearly six football pitches, links warehouses near Tijuana, Mexico and San Diego, USA.</seg>
<seg id="5">The area is filled with nondescript warehouses, making it easier to conceal trucks being loaded with drugs.</seg>
<seg id="6">The tunnel was shut down before any drugs made it through undetected, authorities said.</seg>
<seg id="7">Authorities seized eight-and-a-half tons of marijuana and 327 pounds of cocaine in connection with the tunnel's discovery, according to court records.</seg>
<seg id="8">Three men who authorities say worked as drivers were charged with possession of marijuana and cocaine with intent to distribute.</seg>
<seg id="9">They face prison sentences between 10 years and life imprisonment if convicted.</seg>
<seg id="10">In Nogales, Arizona, smugglers tap into vast underground drainage canals.</seg>
<seg id="11">The tunnel is the eighth major passage discovered in San Diego since 2006.</seg>
<seg id="12">Some of the largest tunnels have been discovered after central Mexico's marijuana harvest in October, which presents drug cartels with a challenge of how to quickly get their product to consumers.</seg>

<seg id="10">How much the savings will affect the Czech Republic, where the group employs around 650 people, and what this will mean for domestic television channel number one, TV Nova, is not yet clear.</seg>
<seg id="11">"It is premature and we really cannot comment," said director of communication at TV Nova, Josef Koukolíček.</seg>
<seg id="12">According to information from MF DNES, significant layoffs will not be avoided in the Czech Republic, but by far the greatest impact should be on staffing levels of CME in Romania and other countries.</seg>
<seg id="13">Both new bosses at Nova, Christoph Mainusch and Michael Del Nin, who took over from long-term director Adrian Sarbu, during Wednesday’s conference call with analysts, spoke about how they would like to restrict all activities not directly related to the television business.</seg>
<seg id="14">It is therefore quite probable that they will significantly restrict in particular the costs of producing their own programmes, the film and production activities.</seg>

<seg id="2">The Treasury have provisionally costed out the CGT measure but are awaiting a final decision from Mr Osborne, who, in the 2012 Budget, introduced a 7% rate of stamp duty for homes costing more than £2m and annual charges for buyers who choose to hold homes in a company rather than as individuals.</seg>
<seg id="3">Already the stamp duty take for residential property in the boroughs of Westminster and Kensington & Chelsea, which stood at £708 million in the 2012/13 tax year, exceeds the combined total for Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, the North East, North West and Yorkshire and the Humber put together.</seg>
<seg id="4">Mr Cook said: "Following increases in stamp duty of high value homes and the introduction of associated anti-avoidance legislation, it is very difficult to argue that high value property is under-taxed irrespective of the effect of the out-dated council tax system."</seg>
<seg id="5">"But this move could make some foreign investors reticent to buy property in London or current owners reluctant to sell," he added.</seg>
<seg id="6">Prime property - the top 5% to 10% of the housing market by price - in the affluent south-west London belt, which stretches from Fulham to Wimbledon, has increased by a record 11.8% over the past year.</seg>

<doc sysid="ref" docid="414-bbc" genre="news" origlang="en">
<seg id="1">Scientists have shed more light on how the movements of a dog's tail are linked to its mood.</seg>
<seg id="2">Earlier research had revealed that happy dogs wag their tails more to the right (from the dog's point of view), while nervous dogs have a left-dominated swish.</seg>
<seg id="3">But now scientists say that fellow canines can spot and respond to these subtle tail differences.</seg>
<seg id="4">Prof Georgio Vallortigara, a neuroscientist from the University of Trento, said: "It is very well known in humans that the left and right side of the brain are differently involved in stimuli that invokes positive or negative emotions."</seg>
<seg id="5">Here we attempted to look at it in other species.</seg>
<seg id="6">He added that just as in humans, for dogs the right side of the brain was responsible for left-handed movement and vice versa, and the two hemispheres played different roles in emotions.</seg>
<seg id="7">To find out more about how dogs react to the lop-sided tail wags of other dogs, the researchers monitored the animals as they watched films of other dogs.</seg>
<seg id="8">They measured the pets' heart rates and analysed their behaviour.</seg>
<seg id="9">It will probably not be long before we understand why their tails sometimes go one way, sometimes the other</seg>
<seg id="10">Prof Vallortigara said: "We presented dogs with movies of dogs - either a naturalistic version or a silhouette to get rid of any other confounding issues, and we could doctor the movement of the tail and present the tail more to the left or right."</seg>
<seg id="11">When the animals saw an otherwise expressionless dog move its tail to the right (from the tail-wagging dog's point of view), they stayed perfectly relaxed.</seg>
<seg id="12">But when they spotted a tail veer predominantly to the left (again from the tail-swishing dog's point of view), their heart rates picked up and they looked anxious.</seg>
<seg id="13">Prof Vallortigara said he didn't think that the dogs were intentionally communicating with each other through these movements.</seg>
<seg id="14">Instead, he believes that they dogs have learned from experience what moves they should and shouldn't feel worried about.</seg>
<seg id="15">He said: "If you have several meetings with other dogs, and frequently their tail wagging one way is associated with a more friendly behaviour, and the right side is producing a less friendly behaviour, you respond on the basis of that experience."</seg>
<seg id="16">The researchers say the findings could give owners, vets and trainers a better insight into their animal's emotions.</seg>
<seg id="17">Dog behaviour expert John Bradshaw, a visiting fellow at the University of Bristol's school of veterinary science, said this was not the first study to examine whether left and right were important to canines.</seg>
<seg id="18">Last year a team from the University of Lincoln found that dogs turn their heads to the left when looking at an aggressive dog and to the right when looking at a happy dog.</seg>
<seg id="19">And in another research paper from the University of Victoria in Canada, he said: "Dogs were more likely to approach a robot dog when its 'tail' was made to wag left rather than right, rather than becoming anxious - the opposite way around to the Italian study."</seg>
<seg id="20">He said the differences could be because the dogs in the different studies were not fully interpreting the animals in the films or robo-dogs as canines.</seg>
<seg id="21">A study of how dogs responded to real dogs could help, he explained.</seg>
<seg id="22">"While there is considerable evidence from many different mammals that the two sides of the brain are used for different purposes, much of the detail still has to be hammered out - and dogs are no exception," he said.</seg>
<seg id="23">However, given the ease with which their behaviour can be recorded, it will probably not be long before we understand why their tails sometimes go one way, sometimes the other.</seg>

<seg id="1">Pope Francis to name first cardinals in February</seg>
<seg id="2">Pope Francis will create new cardinals of the Catholic Church for his first time on February 22, the Vatican announced Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="3">Cardinals are the highest-ranking clergy in the Catholic Church below the pope, and they're the ones who elect popes, so Francis will be appointing his first group of men who will ultimately help choose his successor.</seg>
<seg id="4">There are now 201 cardinals.</seg>
<seg id="5">However, once a cardinal reaches 80 he is no longer permitted to participate in the election of a pope -- this falls to a group of 120 "cardinal electors."</seg>
<seg id="6">In a statement announcing the news, Father Federico Lombardi, a Vatican spokesman, said a meeting of all the existing cardinals would be held before the ceremony to elevate the new cardinals, known as a consistory.</seg>
<seg id="7">"Pope Francis has decided to communicate his decision to convoke February's consistory in advance in order to facilitate the planning of other meetings involving the participation of cardinals from different parts of the world," Lombardi said.</seg>
<seg id="8">Jack Valero of Catholic Voices said that by February, the number of cardinal electors was likely to have dropped.</seg>
<seg id="9">He said usually a pope would name as many cardinals as was needed to raise the number of cardinal electors back to 120 and as many cardinals aged over 80 as he wanted.</seg>
<seg id="10">Next year's consistory would be significant because it would be the first since Francis was elected in March this year, Valero said.</seg>
<seg id="11">At the moment there is a sort of bias towards Europe and especially towards Italy.</seg>
<seg id="12">"It will be interesting to see whether the new Pope will nominate cardinals from the rest of the world to restore the balance," he said.</seg>
<seg id="13">Forty percent of Roman Catholics are in South America, but they have a tiny number of cardinals.</seg>
<seg id="14">The cardinals will also be the first to be chosen since Francis formed the Council of Cardinals, a group of eight cardinals from around the world tasked with looking into ways to reform the church.</seg>
<seg id="15">In the past the Pope decided everything on his own.</seg>
<seg id="16">"Now Francis has selected these eight cardinals to help him," Valero said.</seg>
<seg id="17">He said it was "quite possible" that Francis would ask the cardinals for advice.</seg>
<seg id="18">But we've not been in that situation before -- it's all completely new.</seg>
<seg id="19">Valero said popes typically elevated bishops from large places to the position of cardinal but that Francis was "full of surprises -- so we don't know who he'll name."</seg>

<seg id="2">General Motors Co is recalling nearly 19,000 of its all-new 2014 Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra pickup trucks to repair a problem with the manual reclining seatback, according to a notice from U.S. auto safety regulators on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="3">On some of the trucks, the front seats may have a defect in the reclining mechanism.</seg>
<seg id="4">As a result, the seatbacks fail to comply with federal auto safety standards on head restraints.</seg>
<seg id="5">"If the vehicle is struck from behind, the head restraint may not properly protect occupants, increasing the risk of injury," according to the notice posted on the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration website.</seg>
<seg id="6">The recalled models were built between August 1 and September 10.</seg>
<seg id="7">GM's truck roll-out began in June and represents the most important vehicle launch for the No. 1 U.S. automaker since its 2009 bankruptcy restructuring.</seg>
<seg id="8">GM told truck owners about the defect in the first half of October.</seg>
<seg id="9">NHTSA could not review the owner notification letter due to the 16-day government shutdown, which tempered auto sales growth in October.</seg>
<seg id="10">Sales of the Silverado and Sierra trucks, which were redesigned for the 2014 model year, were up about 20 percent during the first 10 months of the year, GM said on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="11">In October, GM sold 42,660 Silverado and 16,503 Sierra pickup trucks.</seg>
<seg id="12">GM shares were up 1.4 percent at $37.47 on the New York Stock Exchange on Friday afternoon.</seg>

<seg id="1">An Obama voter's cry of despair</seg>
<seg id="2">I voted for President Obama twice, sharing hope in possibility of change</seg>
<seg id="3">He says Obama has had worthy efforts thwarted by GOP obstructionism</seg>
<seg id="4">Obstructionism can't excuse Obamacare website woes, drone attacks</seg>
<seg id="5">Obama's 2008 campaign memoir is a sad reminder of what might have been</seg>
<seg id="6">Nathaniel P. Morris is a second-year student at Harvard Medical School.</seg>
<seg id="7">I'm reading a terribly sad book these days.</seg>
<seg id="8">It's a book that I thought would uplift me during the doldrums of second-year medical school, and renew in me a sense of hope.</seg>
<seg id="9">It's called "The Audacity to Win," and it's a memoir of Barack Obama's 2008 presidential campaign.</seg>
<seg id="10">When I'm finished with my patient write-ups at night and get into bed, the book returns me to a time when politics inspired millions and speeches could take your breath away.</seg>
<seg id="11">The election turned out to be a landslide, and news anchors paused to reflect on the historic nature of the hour.</seg>
<seg id="12">My classmates cried with joy, and my parents saved every newspaper they could find.</seg>
<seg id="13">A young team of visionaries was headed for the White House, and the nation was ready for change.</seg>
<seg id="14">During Obama's transition to office in 2008, he had an 82% approval rating.</seg>
<seg id="15">And then I close the book.</seg>
<seg id="16">Cutting to the present is a rude awakening, like snapping out of a dream.</seg>
<seg id="17">It's hard to remember those days of optimism -- they seem a distant memory, a sad reminder of opportunities gone by.</seg>
<seg id="18">Change indeed happened, in the years since I cast my first ballot.</seg>
<seg id="19">It was simply nothing I could have imagined.</seg>
<seg id="20">I credit Obama with great and varied accomplishments, from the passage of the Affordable Care Act to our military exit from Iraq, the end of "don't ask don't tell," to the killing of Osama bin Laden.</seg>
<seg id="21">Moreover, I believe that partisan obstructionism has upended too many efforts to push our nation forward: immigration reform, a public option for health care, and closing the base at Guantanamo Bay, among others.</seg>
<seg id="22">But, after the countless times in which I have found myself defending the Obama administration to colleagues and peers, I've reached a limit to the explanations that I can provide.</seg>
<seg id="23">I've reached a point of political despair.</seg>
<seg id="24">Republican obstructionism cannot explain allowing the bugging of foreign leaders, nor having drones strike innocent children overseas.</seg>
<seg id="25">It cannot explain having the National Security Agency collect data on the private lives of Americans, nor prosecuting whistle-blowers who reveal government wrongdoing.</seg>
<seg id="26">It cannot account for assassinating Anwar al-Awlaki, an American citizen, without a trial, nor shirking public funding and spending limits during presidential campaigns.</seg>
<seg id="27">It cannot justify the findings of a report that says the White House's efforts to silence the media are the "most aggressive ... since the Nixon Administration."</seg>
<seg id="28">And, most recently, it cannot excuse the failure to design a simple website more than three years since the Affordable Care Act was signed into law.</seg>
<seg id="29">I don't know if this is what I should have expected.</seg>
<seg id="30">If, at 18 years old, I was supposed to figure out that governance may contradict the political campaigns that precede it.</seg>
<seg id="31">Obviously, elective office isn't a predictable course, as the opposing political party and random events, such as the Newtown massacre, will shape our public conversation.</seg>
<seg id="32">Yet, of all of the examples that I have listed above, they largely seem to be of the administration's own choosing.</seg>
<seg id="33">That is what troubles me most of all.</seg>
<seg id="34">I voted for Obama again in 2012, but not because I was excited by his candidacy.</seg>
<seg id="35">Mitt Romney presented a confusing and unrefined alternative who could not seem to lock down his policies or his positions.</seg>
<seg id="36">I felt that a second term for Obama, free from the pressures of future elections, would fulfill the hope that we had heard of for so long.</seg>
<seg id="37">Still, as Obama's approval rating sank below 45% this week, returning to 2008 through that book has become that much harder.</seg>
<seg id="38">It makes me yearn for the many promises that disappeared.</seg>
<seg id="39">This week I was reading the portion of the book describing how Obama suffered a huge loss to Clinton in the Pennsylvania primary.</seg>
<seg id="40">At a post-mortem campaign meeting, he told his staff that they needed to get back on track and stay true to the purpose of their cause.</seg>
<seg id="41">"I want us to get our mojo back," he said.</seg>
<seg id="42">We've got to remember who we are.'</seg>
<seg id="43">It's five years later, Mr. President, and I couldn't agree with you more.</seg>
<seg id="44">The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Nathaniel Morris.</seg>

<seg id="2">Billionaire MP Clive Palmer says Prime Minister Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest over his parental leave scheme because his daughters might get pregnant and benefit from it.</seg>
<seg id="3">The mining magnate, who is in a dispute about paying a $6 million carbon tax bill, made the claim as he tried to brush off questions about whether he had a conflict.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Palmer United Party could control up to four votes in the Senate that may be crucial in deciding if the carbon and mining taxes are axed.</seg>
<seg id="5">But Mr Palmer claimed it was only ministers who could have a conflict of interest and said Mr Abbott's daughters stood to personally benefit from policies.</seg>
<seg id="6">"He's got a major conflict of interest when it comes to paid parental leave because if any of those daughters get pregnant, he'll have a direct interest whether they get leave or not," Mr Palmer said.</seg>
<seg id="7">Two months after the election, the electoral commission officially declared Mr Palmer the winner of the Sunshine Coast seat of Fairfax by 53 votes, after a recount.</seg>
<seg id="8">Mr Palmer called for overhaul of election counting to speed up the process.</seg>
<seg id="9">Tony Abbott's daughters Frances and Bridget.</seg>
<seg id="10">Should this election be decided two months after we stopped voting?</seg>
<seg id="11">"We need to have a better system," he said.</seg>
<seg id="12">Why is it that we shouldn't have a system where you can walk in, punch your details into a computer, vote immediately and have a result at 6.30 that night?</seg>
<seg id="13">Mr Palmer also criticised the use of pencils to mark ballots.</seg>
<seg id="14">Is it because they can rub out the result if someone doesn't like it?</seg>
<seg id="15">In this day and age having a pencil seems extraordinary.</seg>
<seg id="16">The Electoral Commission has been studying options for electronic voting and recently released a joint discussion paper with New Zealand.</seg>
<seg id="17">Mr Palmer, 59, said his policies included an international airport for the Sunshine Coast and he would take "very seriously" his new job.</seg>

<seg id="1">Do you wash your hands?</seg>
<seg id="2">Scientists have discovered that washing your hands can ALSO CHANGE YOUR MOOD.</seg>
<seg id="3">Some 98 people, split into three groups, took part in the experiment.</seg>
<seg id="4">The first two had to solve an impossible task.</seg>
<seg id="5">Of course, neither succeeded.</seg>
<seg id="6">But the group that washed their hands after their failure acted far more optimistically than the one where participants did not wash their hands.</seg>
<seg id="7">Also, the group "with washed hands" performed better in another test than the other.</seg>
<seg id="8">Despite that, those who had washed their hands got worse results in other tests than those who had not washed their hands.</seg>
<seg id="9">The results of those "washed" were on the level of the third group, whose participants had not recorded any previous failure.</seg>
<seg id="10">According to psychologists, the test results show that bodily cleanliness removes actual negative feelings after failure.</seg>
<seg id="11">However, at the same time motivation falls, in further tests the test subjects must concentrate much more.</seg>
<seg id="12">If we transferred the research results to Czechs, we would be the most optimistic after coming back from the toilet.</seg>
<seg id="13">Only one per cent of Czech women and men do not wash their hands after using the toilet, but after travelling on public transport, it is already one fifth.</seg>
<seg id="14">They also take special care to be hygienic after work in the garden or a workshop, when 85 per cent of people wash their hands.</seg>
<seg id="15">Stroking a pet motivates 78.7 per cent of people to wash their hands.</seg>
<seg id="16">A recent survey revealed that a difference exists in the perceptions of Czechs and Slovaks about how necessary it is to wash your hands after shaking hands with a stranger.</seg>
<seg id="17">In this situation, 28.8 per cent of Czechs and 40.3 per cent of Slovaks wash their hands.</seg>
<seg id="18">The survey showed that both nations wash their hands about ten times a day.</seg>
<seg id="19">"Although it would be right, I’m afraid the reality is different and people try to make themselves seem a little better," commented dermatologist Klaudie Komárková on the results of the survey.</seg>

<seg id="2">Royal Bank of Scotland has suspended two traders in its foreign exchange division according to two people familiar with the situation, in another sign that the global probe by regulators into the suspected manipulation of the currency market is rapidly gaining traction.</seg>
<seg id="3">Some of the world's largest banks, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, have confirmed they are co-operating with regulators in investigations into the world's largest financial market, where $5.3tn changes hands each day.</seg>
<seg id="4">The two traders would be the first RBS employees to be suspended in the widening probe that echoes the Libor interbank lending manipulation scandal.</seg>
<seg id="5">The bank, which declined to comment on the suspensions, confirmed this month that it has received requests for information from regulators.</seg>
<seg id="6">"Our ongoing inquiry into this matter continues and we are co-operating fully with the FCA and our other regulators," the bank said two weeks ago.</seg>
<seg id="7">Last month, people close to the situation said that RBS had turned over records of emails and instant messages to the UK regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority, sent to and from a former trader.</seg>
<seg id="8">This trader, Richard Usher, left RBS in 2010 and is understand to have be given leave from his current position as European head of forex spot trading at JPMorgan.</seg>
<seg id="9">Rohan Ramchandani, head of European spot trading at Citi, went on leave this week, while Matt Gardiner, a former senior currencies trader at Barclays and UBS, was suspended by Standard Chartered this week.</seg>
<seg id="10">None of these traders have been accused of any wrongdoing.</seg>
<seg id="11">Mr Usher's instant message group included bankers at Barclays and Citigroup, people close to the situation said.</seg>
<seg id="12">UBS said this week it had taken action against some of its employees after the Swiss regulator, Finma, said it was investigating suspected manipulation of the foreign exchange market at a number of Swiss banks.</seg>
<seg id="13">At least six authorities globally - the European Commission, Finma, Switzerland's competition authority Weko, the FCA, the Department of Justice in the US and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority - are looking at allegations that bankers colluded to move the currencies market.</seg>
<seg id="14">HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Credit Suisse have also launched internal probes or received requests for information from regulators, said people familiar with the situation.</seg>
<seg id="15">Banks are scouring through years" worth of instant messages and emails to search for instances of wrongdoing.</seg>
<seg id="16">News about the probes has rattled traders in an area that has been one of the bigger profit drivers of investment banks' trading units in past years but which has been challenged this year as low volatility in currencies cuts opportunities for speculators.</seg>
<seg id="17">Some bankers have tried to play down the affair by saying the vast and highly liquid foreign exchange market is almost impossible to manipulate, but senior traders are saying this is not necessarily true.</seg>
<seg id="18">A senior trader said that despite the huge volume of daily foreign exchange trading, the fragmentation of liquidity between different trading platforms and banks" increasing use of their own internal platforms meant that "you can start to get an impact on the market at quite small ticket prices."</seg>
<seg id="19">The news came on the same day as Credit Suisse announced it had dismissed a trader at its London exchange traded funds desk this week after he had caused a nearly $6m loss late last year.</seg>
<seg id="20">The bank promptly notified the relevant authorities and has been co-operating with its regulators.</seg>
<seg id="21">"We are confident the trader acted alone and that the matter has been contained," Credit Suisse said.</seg>

<seg id="3">Since the start of monitoring in 1986 to the end of the third quarter this year, tests have confirmed infection in a total of 1005 people from the capital.</seg>

<seg id="2">In a major victory for the Obama administration, the US Supreme Court today ruled Barack Obama's signature health care law is constitutional.</seg>
<seg id="3">By a 5-4 vote, the justices ruled the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act's individual mandate - which requires citizens to buy health insurance by 2014 or else pay a penalty - was constitutional under the taxing power of the government.</seg>
<seg id="4">Chief Justice John Roberts sided with the four more liberal members of the court while Justices Scalia, Thomas, Alito and Kennedy dissented.</seg>
<seg id="5">The court also upheld the remaining sections of the 2700 page law, and further held that the health care law's requirement that states increase Medicaid eligibility or else lose all federal Medicaid funding is not unconstitutionally coercive.</seg>
<seg id="6">The suit to block the law was brought by 26 states and the National Federation of Independent Business.</seg>

<seg id="1">There is no longer any risk of prison for the words "Mugabe is a limping donkey", the court has annulled the law</seg>
<seg id="2">Until now, Zimbabweans had to pay close attention to how to speak in public about 89 year old Mugabe, who has ruled the country since the start of the 1980s; since the end of 1987 he has headed it.</seg>
<seg id="3">Under Section 33 of the Criminal Codification a person could be fined $100 or jailed for up to a year for insulting the president's office.</seg>
<seg id="4">"Prosecutors should not be overzealous about charging people who comment about the president in drinking halls and other social places", representatives of the Constitutional Court said.</seg>
<seg id="5">Nine judges were unanimous in ruling that the law undermined freedom of expression.</seg>
<seg id="6">It is likely that the government will appeal against the court’s ruling, reported the BBC.</seg>
<seg id="7">The law was challenged by several Zimbabweans, including Tendai Danga, who was arrested two years ago for allegedly insulting the president during a row with a policeman in a bar.</seg>
<seg id="8">In May, an opposition activist ended up in prison for regaling Mugabe in public with the insult "limping donkey".</seg>
<seg id="9">In August, the prosecutor accused a 26-year old man of intending to use a poster with Robert Mugabe’s face as toilet paper.</seg>
<seg id="10">The court also declared a law restricting media freedom to be unconstitutional.</seg>
<seg id="11">"The state cannot punish people whose statements are later proven to be false," Deputy Chief Justice Luke Malala said.</seg>
<seg id="12">Up until now, Zimbabwean law has allowed a person who publishes untrue information to be sentenced to twenty years in prison.</seg>
<seg id="13">"The existence of an act allowing criminal prosecution of someone for a false statement has a chilling effect on the right to freedom of expression," added Malala.</seg>
<seg id="14">Despite the fact that Mugabe has ruled the country with an iron fist for over 33 years, in March Zimbabwe accepted a new constitution with broader civil liberties based on a referendum.</seg>
<seg id="15">The country started small steps away from the dictatorship of one man in 2009, when an agreement between Mugabe and the opposition brought in the prime minister Morgan Tsvangirai.</seg>
<seg id="16">Nevertheless, the country continues to suffer from an economic crisis and until 2008 had the highest inflation in the world, which exceeded 100 000 per cent.</seg>
<seg id="17">Therefore in 2009 the government completely abolished the national currency.</seg>
<seg id="18">Today only other countries’ currencies are valid in Zimbabwe.</seg>
<seg id="19">The impoverished economy can be attributed to Mugabe’s rash agricultural reform.</seg>
<seg id="20">In 2000, he reallocated the land of white farmers amongst his supporters and war veterans.</seg>
<seg id="21">However, the majority of them had no experience with running farms.</seg>

<seg id="1">How Tipsport (does not) delete personal data.</seg>
<seg id="2">More than a year ago, I registered on the Tipsport.cz website.</seg>
<seg id="3">However, I did not finish it because at the branch there happened to be someone there who did not know how to complete internet registration.</seg>
<seg id="4">And since I didn’t want to travel to another branch, the registration fell through, then I moved and because of that my address and the number of my ID card changed.</seg>
<seg id="5">When I wanted to complete the registration later, I was told that it wasn’t possible because I had a different ID card number and address and that it just wasn’t possible to complete it and that I should ask for my data to be deleted and do a new registration.</seg>
<seg id="6">So I did that and on 24 October 2013 I wrote to the technical support to request they delete all my personal data from the database according to the current personal data protection act.</seg>
<seg id="7">The next day the technical support wrote to tell me that I had to complete my registration at the branch.</seg>
<seg id="8">This started an email marathon with the technical support, where, in the end, after the 4th demand on 25 October they wrote that they had deleted the personal data as per my request.</seg>
<seg id="9">You would therefore think that you could do that new registration but the problems started again,  first I was told that my username was already taken (I understand that it hadn’t been deleted – it's not personal data, but in the end they removed that too).</seg>
<seg id="10">So I used another username and was told that they already have my personal data saved, and that I should complete registration at a branch (how can they have saved something they say they have deleted?), so I contacted technical support again.</seg>
<seg id="11">In response to my question of how it was possible, they wrote that they really had deleted the personal data on 25 October and that I should send an email with the error.</seg>
<seg id="12">I did that (yesterday around 3pm) and today they replied that I had registered on that same day (31 October 2013) at 1:22pm and that was why it would not work, because I had used the same name and date of birth.</seg>
<seg id="13">What does it matter that I have been in contact with technical support for a week already and I have been trying to sort out with them why it still isn’t working?</seg>
<seg id="14">And what does it matter that if what they say is true (and it isn’t), someone with the same name or date of birth could not register if it is already registered.</seg>
<seg id="15">By the way, at 1:22pm, I did register, with the same name and date of birth, but I used a made-up email and phone number, and lo and behold, a page appeared saying they had sent a link to complete registration to my email.</seg>
<seg id="16">But how is it possible when it isn’t possible to register with the same name and date of birth?</seg>
<seg id="17">Probably because Tipsport ties registration to an email and phone number and the data just has not been removed like they said.</seg>
<seg id="18">So I told technical support this again, that they are just lying (either intentionally or they don’t know what they’re writing), because what they write is not true.</seg>
<seg id="19">I provided evidence with several screenshots that the registration problem existed before 31 October, so the "fake" registration for this simply has nothing to do with it.</seg>
<seg id="20">To that, Tipsport replied with a curt sentence – I’m sorry but as you are now re-registered, we cannot investigate your claim.</seg>
<seg id="21">And ended the communication.</seg>
<seg id="22">Or rather, it is repeating the same line over and over, that the registration is tied to the name and date of birth.</seg>
<seg id="23">They cannot even accept the fact that registration was not completed by clicking on the link in the email and so it did not actually take place.</seg>
<seg id="24">To sum up then, not only Tipsport did not delete data as it claims, but it is lying when it says otherwise.</seg>
<seg id="25">What is worse, it can easily be proven that they are lying and trying to make it look like the error is on the customer’s side.</seg>

<seg id="1">Michal Horáček presents his new double album, his band and three singers</seg>
<seg id="2">Songwriter Michal Horáček brought into the hall at Kolín’s Municipal Social House not only his brand new double CD Czech Calendar, but primarily in the programme Between Us, the singers Lenka Nová, František Segrado and Ondra Ruml, accompanied by the excellent Matěj Benko Orchestra.</seg>
<seg id="3">After the opening intro and theatrical presentation about the musician being late, Michal Horáček gradually invited all three singers on stage, he himself came with a candle in his hand and recalled the story of how he last played in Kolín and in the theatre and the whole town there was a power cut.</seg>
<seg id="4">"Otherwise, in Kolín they made two types of cards, which I came into contact with quite a lot," he recalled.</seg>
<seg id="5">Similarly, he mentioned President Zeman, a native.</seg>
<seg id="6">"Perhaps we could do a tour around Zákolany or Dúbravce near Bratislava," he joked about the native places of other presidents.</seg>
<seg id="7">Several times during the evening, Horáček, who did not leave the stage, and, when he was not talking, sat at a small table with a glass of wine, referred to his new musical act.</seg>
<seg id="8">Josef Mánes made the Calendar too, which put him; but at that time he didn’t know anything about ice hockey, how  we meet in those squares and chant "if you don’t jump you aren’t Czech".</seg>
<seg id="9">That’s the name of one of the songs on Czech Calendar too, but we won’t be playing it here for you today," he said.</seg>
<seg id="10">However, Ondra Ruml sang from this record for him the reportedly very appropriate "Spát ve dne, zpívat po nocích" (Sleep during the day, sing at night), and accompanied himself on guitar.</seg>
<seg id="11">Otherwise, if he was not singing, he played percussion, all three singers were then accompanied by the band consisting of keyboard, cello, guitar and double bass.</seg>
<seg id="12">All three vocalists sang together the old song "Do stráně srdce usedá" (The heart melts into the mountainside), which enlivened the auditorium.</seg>
<seg id="13">"I’m glad you liked the song, which doesn’t surprise me in Kmoch’s town," Michal Horáček responded later.</seg>
<seg id="14">After recalling Peter Hapek, František Segrado played the song "Rozeznávám" (I distinguish), in the original by Richard Müller, and was rewarded with great applause; the song "Táta měl rád Lídu Baarovou" (Dad liked Lída Baarová) brought Hana Hegerová to mind, together with Horáček’s explanation about the Communist ban and replacement of Baarová with the American actress Mae West.</seg>
<seg id="15">The composer Michael Kocáb was recalled by the piece called Sebastian, and then Segrado sang an excellent song Prague, set to music by Jarda Svoboda, a native of Zásmuky and a former Kolín resident.</seg>
<seg id="16">That was the end, however, a standing ovation and an encore in the form of the optimistic song "Žijeme v nádherné doběq" (We live in a wonderful time).</seg>
<seg id="17">There was one more encore on the playlist, but the fans did not applaud enough to get it.</seg>
<seg id="18">Almost immediately after the concert, all four sat at the table signing not just the Czech Calendar but also the older CDs, Michal Horáček signed his books and even the cover of the legendary LP and, if anyone wanted to, he had his photo taken with them.</seg>

<seg id="2">Training for Obama on how to bomb Syria.</seg>
<seg id="3">US commandos in Libya.</seg>
<seg id="4">TOP GUN in the Persian Gulf.</seg>
<seg id="5">The Israelis have shown exactly how bombing Syria should look.</seg>
<seg id="6">Without unnecessary hype, threats and a million declarations, they sent planes, they hit the target and came back.</seg>
<seg id="7">Without being lulled into a false sense of security by the official removal of chemical weapons in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="8">They refuse to confirm the whole event and are no longer commenting on it.</seg>
<seg id="9">The exact opposite of the confused and grandiose Obama’s Syrian policy unsupported by actions.</seg>
<seg id="10">And the most satisfactory thing about the whole attack was what the Israelis bombed.</seg>
<seg id="11">Don’t be fooled by media claims that a "Syrian base" or "supplies for Hezbollah" were bombed.</seg>
<seg id="12">I recently wrote here that while US aid to secular rebels in the country has remained on just a rhetorical level, Russia happily continues to supply weapons to Syria.</seg>
<seg id="13">And it was a fresh supply of Russian missiles unloaded in the port of Latakia that became the target of the Israeli air strike.</seg>
<seg id="14">A clear message.</seg>
<seg id="15">And note that Israel again bombed the Assad regime, not the rebels, although it should have been the opposite according to popular internet theories.</seg>
<seg id="16">The US government has honoured two members of special units, probably Delta Force.</seg>
<seg id="17">No one suspected until now that they distinguished themselves during the attack on the US consulate in Benghazi.</seg>
<seg id="18">The heroic death of two former SEALs, who defended the CIA site in the city, is known, in my opinion they were members of the secret CIA commando, which is made up of former soldiers.</seg>
<seg id="19">There has long been speculation about what the SEALs were doing at the consulate or even in another CIA residence elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="20">Now it is clearer.</seg>
<seg id="21">In any case, information that the CIA has its offices in Libya protected by machine gun nests (it was in one of them that both members of SEALs were killed after being hit by a mine-thrower) is quite surprising.</seg>
<seg id="22">But even more surprising is the information about the two as yet unknown heroes.</seg>
<seg id="23">They were part of the US task force in Tripoli, and as soon as they received the report on the attack in Benghazi, they volunteered to intervene, and together with five private contractors, they blasted their way into the CIA site in Benghazi.</seg>
<seg id="24">Obama’s administration is compromised by the fact that during this attack the task force was not officially deployed as a whole and that they simply hesitated over what to do.</seg>
<seg id="25">The task force commander therefore apparently releases these volunteers without orders.</seg>
<seg id="26">In any case, the fact that the US task force, CIA agents and private contractors are active not just once but permanently is quite interesting information.</seg>
<seg id="27">And due to the fact that until recently officially nothing of the sort was admitted and even now they only talk about some sort of NATO advisory mission in Libya.</seg>
<seg id="28">It is good, however, that the USA, even though half-heartedly, is trying to combat terrorism in Libya.</seg>
<seg id="29">Although for resolving the nationwide situation, it would need far more help.</seg>
<seg id="30">The last place for a secret and permanent conflict that I want to write about today is the Iranian coast.</seg>
<seg id="31">It was not long ago that the media all but extolled the Iranian air force for chasing US drones.</seg>
<seg id="32">However, little is known about how the Americans effectively protect their drones.</seg>
<seg id="33">Of course, if by chance they succeed in finding their drone in the air space, nothing can be done about it.</seg>
<seg id="34">If, however, the Iranians discover a drone in international space, the situation is completely different.</seg>
<seg id="35">And so it happened that the Iranian F-4 Phantom aircraft followed an American drone in the international space above the ocean, when perhaps the first serious deployment of the US super fighter F-22 Raptor in history took place.</seg>
<seg id="36">It flew beneath the Phantom to check optically for weapons, without the Phantom registering it on the radar or he just noticed it and then when it suddenly it appeared close by and called on the Iranian pilot to go home, he obeyed without complaint.</seg>
<seg id="37">It is no wonder when the Phantom is a US-made aircraft which does however remember the Vietnam war.</seg>
<seg id="38">It cannot be compared with the Raptor.</seg>

<seg id="1">We want to show that Plzen still knows how to win, promises Rajtoral</seg>
<seg id="2">It is a bit of a paradox.</seg>
<seg id="3">Whilst his team has mainly failed recently with its results, defender and midfielder of Viktoria Plzen, Frantisek Rajtoral, has been on form which has earned him a return to the national team.</seg>
<seg id="4">He is also successful shooting, he is full of energy; after a tackle on him in the Teplice game, a penalty kick was awarded.</seg>
<seg id="5">Viktoria was reaching for victory in the last two rounds against Slavia and Teplice, but in the end it only took one point from these two duels.</seg>
<seg id="6">Frantisek Rajtoral believes that his team will break this unpleasant series in the game with Jablonec.</seg>
<seg id="7">We want to show that we can win.</seg>
<seg id="8">"I believe that we will beat Jablonec at home," promises Frantisek Rajtoral.</seg>
<seg id="9">The team is preparing carefully for the difficult match with the North Bohemians, who play attacking football.</seg>
<seg id="10">Everything is focussed on the game with Jablonec, the coach is preparing us well, and as always we’re getting a lot from the game analysis video of the opposition.</seg>
<seg id="11">"I believe that it will be an excellent match on Friday evening," says the Czech international to attract fans to the stands of the Doosan Arena.</seg>
<seg id="12">Plzen’s last matches have not gone the way they wanted, but the Viktoria defender rejects the word crisis.</seg>
<seg id="13">That’s the way it goes in football, sometimes you’re on good form and sometimes it’s worse.</seg>
<seg id="14">But I wouldn’t call it a crisis in any case.</seg>
<seg id="15">"I believe that we will win on Friday and it will be good again," says the West Bohemian defender.</seg>
<seg id="16">The Viktoria team will again rely on the support of its fans.</seg>
<seg id="17">"We are playing on Friday evening and I’d like to take this opportunity to invite our great fans."</seg>
<seg id="18">"I believe that we’ll reward them with a win," adds Rajtoral.</seg>

<seg id="1">Jana Péťová: A step back.</seg>
<seg id="2">So I decided to take a step back, but when I think about it, it isn’t actually about a step at all, but a big jump – a jump several years back, into memories of my childhood.</seg>
<seg id="3">It is a memory of how it was, to have no worries and just come home from school and wash dishes, hoover, and do homework.</seg>
<seg id="4">Even though these "chores" were mostly just a theory, my parents’ wishes.</seg>
<seg id="5">The practice was completely different – run home from school, throw my bag in a corner and run outside.</seg>
<seg id="6">Play ball games with other children, and hopscotch.</seg>
<seg id="7">Then, during the TV series Helen and the Guys, embroider a festive cloth for grandma’s birthday using chain stitch.</seg>
<seg id="8">And only after several warnings finally wash the dishes, hoover, in winter carry the wood to the tiled stove and do homework under the lamplight once the sun had set (or rely on a classmate and instead of homework write love poetry addressed to your school sweetheart).</seg>
<seg id="9">In the morning eat homemade strawberry jam (from real fruit, not the sort of jam they sell now, with contents that have not even been anywhere near a strawberry), and wash it down with tea from dried herbs, which we so gladly collected with mum.</seg>
<seg id="10">I also remember those magic evenings, when there was a deathly silence in the little room, when my sister and I recorded songs from the radio on tapes, which turned noisily in an old tape player from mum.</seg>
<seg id="11">And then we rewound those tapes with a pencil and put one song on again and again, our favourite, and drank soda water with it.</seg>
<seg id="12">Or we phoned each other across the table using tins which were tied together with string – and while we’re talking phones, so we could hear each other better, it was necessary to clean our ears thoroughly, and at the time our ear cleaners were matches and cotton wool.</seg>
<seg id="13">The minimum wage was over three times lower than it is now and my parents could live on it in such a way that we lacked nothing.</seg>
<seg id="14">We didn’t need any of those iPhones, iPads or even mobile phones and laptops or designer clothing.</seg>
<seg id="15">Clothes were handed down from generation to generation and the best "addition" to the wardrobe was a home-made tie-dyed T-shirt using SAVA dye.</seg>
<seg id="16">For electronics, we were happy with that tape recorder of mum’s and, at the most, a Walkman which I shared with my sister and which, by the way, we only used on the train on a school trip.</seg>
<seg id="17">We thought it was more interesting to play Flying Hats or Ludo with our aunt, or as I said before, "just" go outside.</seg>
<seg id="18">When I was a bit older, we got a video recorder under the Christmas tree, which my parents had clearly saved for for a long time, but unfortunately it did not last long with us.</seg>
<seg id="19">My younger sister stuffed a piece of strudel into it, apparently it eating the tapes so nicely, so she wanted to see if it would eat the strudel too.</seg>
<seg id="20">Unfortunately it did eat it, but it was its last mouthful.</seg>
<seg id="21">Well, the poor thing hears this story over and over again from dad to this day.</seg>
<seg id="22">He says that when Lenka was little, she stuffed strudel in the video and thought that it would play a recipe and it didn’t play it, so to this day she doesn’t know how to bake it.</seg>
<seg id="23">I remember how we all managed to communicate together, to make arrangements without a mobile or computer.</seg>
<seg id="24">During the holidays at grandma’s, my sister and I agreed with the neighbour’s granddaughter when we would meet again the following year in summer at our grandmas’ houses – and that’s how it was, how it stood.</seg>
<seg id="25">We met.</seg>
<seg id="26">Do you promise to see someone in a year nowadays?</seg>
<seg id="27">I also remember winter, when we ran outside with the whole village, built snowmen, and rode bags stuffed with hay on the snowy hill by the church.</seg>
<seg id="28">Then the whole family ate dinner together and talked about the  last day.</seg>
<seg id="29">Of course, my sister and I would hear that infamous line before every evening meal: "Go and wash your hands!"</seg>
<seg id="30">Yes, it still applies today, but you definitely don’t have soap tied to the tap in the bathroom in a net for lemons.</seg>
<seg id="31">After dinner, when dad was "working" in the garage, having a beer with Jarda from the village, we lay on the floor with mum, propped our feet against the tiled stove, opened the little doors and looked at the flames, and listened to the crackle of wood, which drifted out of the stove.</seg>
<seg id="32">We were closer – really – we didn’t count the number of friends we had on social networks, we knew how many friends we had, the real ones!</seg>
<seg id="33">We communicated together – we spoke – we didn’t write messages every day on various chat programs or text.</seg>
<seg id="34">Nothing like that existed, and despite that we knew far more about each other.</seg>
<seg id="35">And I could carry on like that for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="36">It is beautiful to remember, especially if I add to the memories by looking through an album, where there are neatly glued  black and white photos with black corners.</seg>
<seg id="37">And if by any chance I didn’t know how old I was then, the year the picture was taken is always written on the back of the photo.</seg>
<seg id="38">I see that although our pudding bowl haircuts didn’t really suit us, and our trousers were from our little cousin and two sizes too big, nobody used to laugh at us, it was normal like that (not in).</seg>
<seg id="39">And now I’d better return that step forward – to reality.</seg>
<seg id="40">To 2013, and I’ll wait and see what the modern age will invent, perhaps one day for my children.</seg>
<seg id="41">What I do know is this, that my memories are now for the young adolescent generation at least "from the Stone Age" and I think they are missing out on a lot, that they won’t experience "the Stone Age" period too.</seg>
<seg id="42">I wish they could!</seg>

<seg id="1">Google, Samsung, Huawei sued over Nortel patents</seg>
<seg id="2">The group that owns thousands of former Nortel patents filed a barrage of patent lawsuits on Thursday against cell phone manufacturers including Google, the company it outbid in the Nortel bankruptcy auction.</seg>
<seg id="3">Rockstar, the consortium that bought the Nortel patents for $4.5 billion, sued Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, HTC Corp, Huawei and four other companies for patent infringement in U.S. District Court in Texas.</seg>
<seg id="4">Rockstar is jointly owned by Apple, Microsoft, Blackberry, Ericsson and Sony.</seg>
<seg id="5">Google is accused of infringing seven patents.</seg>
<seg id="6">The patents cover technology that helps match Internet search terms with relevant advertising, the lawsuit said, which is the core of Google's search business.</seg>
<seg id="7">Representatives for Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar could not immediately be reached.</seg>
<seg id="8">Samsung, Huawei and HTC all manufacture phones that operate on Google's Android operating system, which competes fiercely with Apple and Microsoft mobile products.</seg>
<seg id="9">In 2011 Google placed an initial $900 million bid for Nortel's patents.</seg>
<seg id="10">Google increased its bid several times, ultimately offering as much as $4.4 billion.</seg>
<seg id="11">After losing out to Rockstar on the Nortel patents, Google went on to acquire Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion, a deal driven partly by Motorola's library of patents.</seg>
<seg id="12">"Despite losing in its attempt to acquire the patents-in-suit at auction, Google has infringed and continues to infringe," the lawsuit said.</seg>
<seg id="13">Rockstar is seeking increased damages against Google, as it claims Google's patent infringement is willful, according to the complaint.</seg>

<seg id="1">Egypt swears in first freely elected president</seg>
<seg id="2">Mohamed Morsi takes the oath of office but his day of triumph is unlikely to mark end of political strife in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="3">ISLAMIST Mohamed Morsi promised a "new Egypt" as he took the oath of office to become the country's first freely elected president, succeeding Hosni Mubarak who was ousted 16 months ago.</seg>
<seg id="4">At his inauguration before the Supreme Constitutional Court, Morsi also became the Arab world's first freely elected Islamist president and Egypt's fifth head of state since the overthrow of the monarchy some 60 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="5">He took the oath before the court's 18 black-robed judges in its Nile-side seat built to resemble an ancient Egyptian temple.</seg>
<seg id="6">"We aspire to a better tomorrow, a new Egypt and a second republic," Morsi said during a solemn ceremony shown live on state television.</seg>
<seg id="7">"Today, the Egyptian people laid the foundation of a new life - absolute freedom, a genuine democracy and stability," said Morsi, a 60-year-old US-trained engineer from the Muslim Brotherhood, a fundamentalist group that has spent most of the 84 years since its inception as an outlawed organisation harshly targeted by successive governments.</seg>
<seg id="8">Hundreds of soldiers and policemen guarded the building as Morsi arrived shortly after 11am local time in a small motorcade.</seg>
<seg id="9">Only several hundred supporters gathered outside the court to cheer the new president and, in a departure from the presidential pomp of the Mubarak years, traffic was only briefly halted to allow his motorcade through on the usually busy road linking the city centre with its southern suburbs.</seg>
<seg id="10">Derided as the Brotherhood's uncharismatic "spare tyre," his personal prestige has surged since his victory and his delivery of a Friday speech that tried to present him as a candidate not just of Islamists but of all those who want to complete the work of the 2011 uprising against the authoritarian Mubarak.</seg>
<seg id="11">"Egypt today is a civil, national, constitutional and modern state," Morsi, wearing a blue business suit and a red tie, told the judges in the wood-panelled chamber where he took the oath of office.</seg>
<seg id="12">Morsi later travelled to Cairo University where he was to make his inauguration address.</seg>
<seg id="13">He was given an official welcome by an army band that played the national anthem as he stood to attention.</seg>
<seg id="14">Military ruler Field Marshal Hussein Tantawi was in attendance.</seg>
<seg id="15">His arrival was greeted with chants of, "The army and the people are one hand," from the hundreds gathered in the university's main lecture room.</seg>
<seg id="16">Established in 1908 as a bastion of secular education, Cairo University later became a stronghold of Islamist student groups in the 1970s.</seg>
<seg id="17">Morsi took a symbolic oath on Friday in Tahrir Square, birthplace of the uprising that ended Mubarak's authoritarian rule last year, and vowed to reclaim presidential powers stripped from his office by the military council that took over from the ousted leader.</seg>
<seg id="18">But by agreeing to take the official oath before the court, rather than before parliament as is customary, he is bowing to the military's will in an indication that the contest for power will continue.</seg>
<seg id="19">Morsi's speech in Tahrir Square was filled with dramatic populist gestures.</seg>

<seg id="1">Ghettos will probably get police specialists, intended to ease tensions</seg>
<seg id="2">Ghettos in the Czech Republic may get police specialists in the future.</seg>
<seg id="3">They would spend up to half of their time on the beat there.</seg>
<seg id="4">They would supervise order and solve problems.</seg>
<seg id="5">Thanks to their knowledge of the environment, they would contribute to reducing tensions between people from impoverished areas and residents in the vicinity.</seg>
<seg id="6">The Ministry of the Interior is counting on this in its proposal to reduce security risks.</seg>
<seg id="7">According to the Minister it is especially "the speedy provision of social housing" that would help to improve the situation in the country.</seg>
<seg id="8">The government has discussed the document.</seg>
<seg id="9">According to analysis, there were around 300 impoverished homes and neighbourhoods in the Czech Republic a couple of years ago.</seg>
<seg id="10">Around 80,000 people lived in them, mainly Roma.</seg>
<seg id="11">Adults in the ghettos were unemployed, families relied on benefits, children ended up in "special" schools.</seg>
<seg id="12">Loan sharks ran rampant.</seg>
<seg id="13">According to experts, the number of problem localities has increased by a hundred.</seg>
<seg id="14">Relations between their residents and the others are deteriorating.</seg>
<seg id="15">In some locations, anti-Roma marches have taken place.</seg>
<seg id="16">Extremists were joined by local people.</seg>
<seg id="17">According to the Ministry of the Interior, it is difficult for police in areas with ghettos to maintain security and order.</seg>
<seg id="18">A basic condition is apparently the "strict application of an equal approach in law enforcement."</seg>
<seg id="19">However, without detailed knowledge of the place and the people, this is reportedly not possible to achieve.</seg>
<seg id="20">The specialists would patrol in the ghetto, where they would spend up to half of their time on the beat and the rest of time they would served in their areas.</seg>
<seg id="21">In a problem area they would supervise the order.</seg>
<seg id="22">They would also know the local people, so they could better deal with problems and offences.</seg>
<seg id="23">"Thanks to the establishment of trust, the specialists will be more easily able to prevent a whole range of unlawful behaviour," said the ministry.</seg>
<seg id="24">Specialists in ghettos would receive extra pay, from 500 to 1000 crowns a month.</seg>
<seg id="25">Introducing special police officers in problem areas is to be covered by the Norway Grants.</seg>
<seg id="26">The budget is about EUR 600,000 (now about 15.5 million crowns).</seg>
<seg id="27">The Czech Republic pays 15 per cent of the sum, and the grants 85 per cent.</seg>
<seg id="28">Preparations have begun this year, and a detailed proposal is now being prepared.</seg>
<seg id="29">The project should last until 2016.</seg>
<seg id="30">The authors have been inspired by their neighbours.</seg>
<seg id="31">This mechanism has already been successfully applied for several years in Slovakia, where the problem with socially excluded areas is much higher than in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="32">"There are so-called Roma settlements here," said the report’s authors.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is not yet clear how many specialists there are to be in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="34">Analysis will give the answer and define the places where special police officers would be necessary.</seg>
<seg id="35">It will also depend on how much money the police will be able to provide each year for these officers once the project has ended.</seg>
<seg id="36">According to the project proposal, the police officers selected will first complete a training course in Slovakia.</seg>
<seg id="37">Each year some fifty officers should complete this training course.</seg>
<seg id="38">The most suitable candidates will come from those.</seg>
<seg id="39">A special training course for police officers who will work in the ghettos should also be established.</seg>
<seg id="40">According to the authors, it is above all the social housing that would help to improve the situation.</seg>
<seg id="41">It would reportedly motivate and lead to integration.</seg>
<seg id="42">According to the Interior Ministry’s ideas, there would be three standard categories.</seg>
<seg id="43">The minimum standard would be met by hostels with precisely stipulated rules, such as the number of people per room.</seg>
<seg id="44">The medium standard would be the smaller flats.</seg>
<seg id="45">The higher standard would be the social flats, which would be comparable with regular accommodation.</seg>
<seg id="46">Tenants would have to fulfil an integration plan, which would be prepared by social workers  together with. tenants</seg>

<seg id="1">Karel Drábek: Uhlířský Vrch – One of our youngest volcanoes.</seg>
<seg id="2">Uhlířský Vrch is a prominent hill 3 km southeast of Bruntál.</seg>
<seg id="3">Together with several others, it is a proof of volcanic activity in the Nízký Jeseník hills in the recent period (from a geological perspective).</seg>
<seg id="4">The last eruptions here were still taking place at the beginning of the Quaternary period.</seg>
<seg id="5">When viewed from a greater distance, the whitewashed Baroque pilgrimage church of Our Lady of Succour, built between 1755 and 1765, is prominent on the peak.</seg>
<seg id="6">It replaced the original wooden pilgrimage chapel.</seg>
<seg id="7">The inn, which stood next to the church, was not preserved.</seg>
<seg id="8">Shortly after the completion of the church, an avenue with four rows of lime trees was planted, about 1 km long.</seg>
<seg id="9">The Way of the Cross on Uhlířský Vrch is already the third version – the original stood here after 1916, the second version from 2001 only lasted until 2004.</seg>
<seg id="10">There are fifteen stations with wooden sculptures made by local wood carver František Nedomlel.</seg>
<seg id="11">He used various types of wood from the Nízký Jeseník area.</seg>
<seg id="12">Similarly, the pedestals made from rock from the local area form an interesting geological exposition.</seg>
<seg id="13">At each station there is also the name of the sponsor.</seg>
<seg id="14">Uhlířský Vrch is the remainder of a young volcano.</seg>
<seg id="15">Although data from radiometric measurements of the age somewhat differ, the last eruption here took place about 1.5 million years ago.</seg>
<seg id="16">It is therefore younger than Velký Roudný (3.3 million years old) and older than Venušina sopka or Venus Volcano (0.8 million years old).</seg>
<seg id="17">The volcano came into existence after an explosion.</seg>
<seg id="18">During the explosion, it spat out large amounts of volcanic ash together with rock fragments from the bedrock, which were burnt to get their reddish-brown colour.</seg>
<seg id="19">At the end of this stage, lava flowed out on the surface – now it is a layer of porous basalt up to 13 metres thick.</seg>
<seg id="20">A second eruption spewed out red, brown-red and in places almost black tuffs.</seg>
<seg id="21">The layer is up to 50 metres thick and the part of it is accessible in the face of a quarry.</seg>
<seg id="22">The tuffs contain prominent volcanic bombs up to 1 metre in size. The second eruption also ended with an outflow of lava.</seg>
<seg id="23">At the end of the activity, lava flowed out of the volcano, forming a layer of slaggy basalt which is now up to 50 m thick.</seg>
<seg id="24">Volcanoes where layers of volcanic ash alternate with flows of lava are the most common type of volcano.</seg>
<seg id="25">Since they are actually composed of layers, they given the name of stratovolcanoes.</seg>
<seg id="26">The original volcanic cone was subjected to gradual erosion.</seg>
<seg id="27">However, it was not threatened until the mining of rock started at a quarry on the south side.</seg>
<seg id="28">The most intensive mining took place there from 1953 to 1962.</seg>
<seg id="29">Tuffs were added to concrete, which was then lighter and had better thermal insulation properties.</seg>
<seg id="30">Under pressure from specialists and the public, it was possible to stop the mining and thus preserve this unique place.</seg>
<seg id="31">However, the problem is the porosity and the low coherence of the rocks, which quickly weather, break apart and fall down the slope.</seg>
<seg id="32">This means the quarry is quickly disappearing.</seg>
<seg id="33">To make the situation even more complicated, the warm, south-orientated slope is an ideal location for some rare species of plants and animals.</seg>
<seg id="34">Rectifying it is therefore problematic, but in time it will be necessary to make a choice and maintain the characteristic geological profile.</seg>
<seg id="35">This is nothing new, similar profiles are being maintained at several important sites.</seg>
<seg id="36">You can get to Uhlířský Vrch following the green tourist trail from Bruntál, or from Slezský Kočov.</seg>
<seg id="37">Drivers can use the free car park at the beginning of the avenue with lime trees, where also a short pedestrian path begins.</seg>

<seg id="1">She moved from a villa to an apartment building.</seg>
<seg id="2">Ivana grew up and spent most of her life in a rented villa with a garden and swimming pool in one of the most beautiful residential areas of Prague in Ořechovka.</seg>
<seg id="3">The original house owners, however, got it back in restitution and the tenants had to move out with little compensation.</seg>
<seg id="4">So Ivana looked for another accommodation quickly for herself and her already elderly mother.</seg>
<seg id="5">She got a tip from friends for a three room flat with kitchenette in an older apartment building on the other side of Prague.</seg>
<seg id="6">"At first it was a shock, but on the other hand, the view from the fourth flour of the vast forest park and reservoir impressed me," says Ivana, recalling her first impression.</seg>
<seg id="7">At first I told myself it would be a temporary arrangement for about three years.</seg>
<seg id="8">"We’ve been here now for over thirteen years and I wouldn’t change it, not just because of the gradual reconstruction," adds the owner.</seg>
<seg id="9">The mother and daughter moved at the time from a 120 m2 home to a smaller one with an area of 62 m2 and gave away practically all their furnishings.</seg>
<seg id="10">It was not an easy undertaking, the things were stored with friends and the gradual furnishing took almost a year.</seg>
<seg id="11">The new flat was in quite a good condition, but they had to carry out necessary repairs, for example varnishing doors and replacing the windows.</seg>
<seg id="12">The previous owner had knocked down the inner walls, but the new owner was most bothered by the impractically designed and excessively large hallway and, in contrast, the small bathroom.</seg>
<seg id="13">Joining the two rooms created a multifunctional living space.</seg>
<seg id="14">To define the separate zones and room divisions, the architects used plasterboard, which allowed repositioning of the lights.</seg>
<seg id="15">The first action she decided to take after a couple of years was to remove the partition wall in the living room.</seg>
<seg id="16">This change the layout of the flat to a two-room flat with kitchenette, but it gave her an airy room from which opened up a panoramic view of the surrounding greenery.</seg>
<seg id="17">Another step to partial improvement of the standard was replacing the PVC flooring with laminate flooring.</seg>
<seg id="18">Ivana did not know what to do with the bathroom.</seg>
<seg id="19">For years I was buying home design magazines looking for inspiration.</seg>
<seg id="20">In one of them I recently discovered an interesting completed project.</seg>
<seg id="21">On a recommendation, I approached a young female architect Kamila Douděrová.</seg>
<seg id="22">"It was actually the most important step for the future," says Ivana.</seg>
<seg id="23">Thanks to the reconstruction of the bathroom, it was possible to adjust the layout of the hallway.</seg>
<seg id="24">The architect joined the spaces for the WC and the  bathroom and replaced the two hinged doors with one sliding door, which saved space.</seg>
<seg id="25">The bathroom is timeless and is also sufficiently barrier free.</seg>
<seg id="26">Quality tiles imitate sandstone, in the shower there is also a comfortable seat, and by the toilet there is a bidet.</seg>
<seg id="27">The successful collaboration with Kamila Douděrová continued on.</seg>
<seg id="28">As part of the TV programme Building a Dream, there was a quick but fundamental alteration of the living room, with the architect Martin Čeněk also taking part.</seg>
<seg id="29">In the space formed by joining the two smaller rooms, we had to get three functional areas – dining, living and sleeping – without the help of traditional principles for optical separation, such as semi partition walls and Japanese blinds.</seg>
<seg id="30">"That would in the end disrupt the openness and unity of the space," explains the architect.</seg>
<seg id="31">It was possible to divide the sleeping and living areas in an original way.</seg>
<seg id="32">All it took was to put two sofas back to back and place a made-to-measure duvet cabinet between them.</seg>
<seg id="33">The dining area is defined by the colours of the floor and the walls.</seg>
<seg id="34">On the floor in the kitchen and dining area, the architect used high quality marmoleum tiles, and she brightened up the sliding doors with patterned wallpaper.</seg>
<seg id="35">If necessary, the kitchenette can be closed off with the papered sliding panels covered with wallpaper.</seg>
<seg id="36">Compared with the previous laminate floor, the new anti-allergy marmoleum floor has a number of advantages: a softer non-slip surface with no gaps and better sound insulation.</seg>
<seg id="37">The system of alcoves and ceilings made of plasterboard highlighted in colour is an example of how you can work with space in an apartment building.</seg>
<seg id="38">I left the colourdesign to the architects, I wanted it to be cheerful.</seg>
<seg id="39">"I like orange colour, I had the same shade in my last flat," says Ivana.</seg>
<seg id="40">The graphic glass tiling with a blossoming magnolia motif is practical and creates a striking aesthetic element.</seg>
<seg id="41">The architects chose white for a warm energetic tone, which highlighted the modern functional style.</seg>
<seg id="42">In the small flat, they managed to store books also in the space under the window ledges.</seg>
<seg id="43">Everything is within reach, lamps are comfortably controlled remotely.</seg>
<seg id="44">In the altered interior, the contrast between the new and;old works beautifully, for example, the decades old crystal chandelier and the quality works of art which Ivana has been collecting all her life.</seg>
<seg id="45">Last in line came the kitchen.</seg>
<seg id="46">The cupboards had previously been placed along both sides and the owner felt as ii she was in a tunnel.</seg>
<seg id="47">The architect reduced their number and rearranged their positioning.</seg>
<seg id="48">The simply designed furniture is custom made, the white surface softened by the slightly nacred finish.</seg>
<seg id="49">Thanks to imaginative design, a washing machine, dryer and dishwasher have been fitted into the small space.</seg>
<seg id="50">The appearance of the small kitchen is enlivened by the all-glass tiling above the work bench.</seg>
<seg id="51">The unique graphic glass with digitally printed motif is attractive and easy to keeps clean.</seg>
<seg id="52">Ivana chose magnolia blossoms, which remind her of her favourite neighbourhood, where she lived for years.</seg>
<seg id="53">Now it seems that she is also happy here.</seg>
<seg id="54">In the original bathroom, there was a small bath and wash basin, for the new bathroom the owner chose neutral colour tiles.</seg>
<seg id="55">The large shower recess has a Ronal glass door.</seg>
<seg id="56">The task was to create a clear, simple space in the given environment, in which the functions and fittings would be in harmony.</seg>
<seg id="57">We unified the interior in terms of materials and colours and tried to give it an elegant, cosy, uncluttered appearance.</seg>
<seg id="58">"Another condition of the brief was the open space design with minimal obstruction, allowing easy movement around furniture and with objects of daily use within reach," adds Kamila Douděrová.</seg>

<seg id="1">Anti-corruption police officer also arrested together with Vít Bárta</seg>
<seg id="2">Bárta’s defence lawyer, Oldřich Chudoba, who also represented him in the case of alleged corruption of public affairs deputies, did not want to comment too much on the matter, but said: "Yes, I’m representing the client in this matter as well, but with regard to protection of classified information, I cannot comment further."</seg>
<seg id="3">According to information from the newspaper Právo, the case is being handled by the General Inspectorate of the Security Forces (GIBS).</seg>
<seg id="4">The server tn.cz stated that Bárta could have bought classified information from the police.</seg>
<seg id="5">According to the server prvnizpravy.cz, the case may be related to the case concerning the former chief of police Petr Lessy, whose appointment was allegedly supported by Bárta.</seg>
<seg id="6">However, recent information from Právo shows that the arrest of Vít Bárta is not related to Petr Lessy.</seg>
<seg id="7">Eva Kropáčová, spokesperson for police headquarters, refused to comment on the matter, since the case is being dealt with by the Prague Municipal Prosecutor's Office.</seg>
<seg id="8">"We will not comment on this query with regard to the protection of classified information," Štěpánka Zenklová, spokesperson for the Prague Municipal Prosecutor’s Office, told Právo on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="9">Their prosecutor is supervising the Bárta matter, and the prosecutor's words indirectly indicate that the file or the criminal proceedings are being conducted in a classified regime.</seg>
<seg id="10">A reporter from Novinky succeeded in catching Kateřina Klasnová, Vít Bárta’s wife, in the morning outside their home in Prague’s Klárov area.</seg>
<seg id="11">She was putting suitcases into the car and then drove off.</seg>
<seg id="12">She refused to comment on the entire event.</seg>
<seg id="13">On Friday morning, the leader of the Dawn movement, Tomio Okamura, commented on Bárta’s arrest.</seg>
<seg id="14">In his words, he has no idea what the case is about.</seg>
<seg id="15">"Vít Bárta was one of many candidates from many parties on our list of candidates, and as I said repeatedly before the election, he was not and is not a member of Tomio Okamura's Dawn of Direct Democracy," he added.</seg>
<seg id="16">Vít Bárta, who in previous early elections was an unsuccessful candidate to the Chamber for the Plzen region for Tomio Okamura's Dawn of Direct Democracy movement, is known for his corruption case for bribing public affairs deputies.</seg>
<seg id="17">In April 2012, he was conditionally sentenced to 18 months, which was deferred for 30 months.</seg>

<seg id="1">Prospal: I want a contract in the NHL.</seg>
<seg id="2">I still have the spirit, desire and enthusiasm</seg>
<seg id="3">Family was always in first place for Prospal, which is why he wants to submit himself to it fully at the age of 38.</seg>
<seg id="4">Either he will get work abroad and continue to extend his career, or he will stop playing hockey for good.</seg>
<seg id="5">"I want to fulfil my role of dad and husband."</seg>
<seg id="6">"I can’t wait," says the hockey player, who is still waiting in vain for an offer.</seg>
<seg id="7">Despite the fact that he is well-known as a hard worker, who never cheats anything.</seg>
<seg id="8">Despite the fact he always leaves his heart on the ice and can also lead his team-mates.</seg>
<seg id="9">And also despite the fact that he was the most productive player of Columbus last season.</seg>
<seg id="10">"But the desire to show everyone what I’ve got is still there," he says with determination.</seg>
<seg id="11">Maybe he will live to see it, allegedly New York Rangers are interested in him, they had an unsuccessful start to the season and, in addition, they have two mainstays injured – the attackers Rick Nash and Ryan Callahan.</seg>
<seg id="12">How is it with your transfer to Rangers?</seg>
<seg id="13">It’s just speculation.</seg>
<seg id="14">Unless I get something on paper, there’s no point to think about it.</seg>
<seg id="15">I know there was an article that came out in the New York Post that they should sign me, but that is all.</seg>
<seg id="16">It was not said anywhere that this really happened..</seg>
<seg id="17">Unfortunately, I would like to say myself that I have a contract, but it just isn’t the case.</seg>
<seg id="18">Has the club not even contacted you?</seg>
<seg id="19">That kind of communication takes place every day in the NHL.</seg>
<seg id="20">There it’s about getting into a situation where the contract really arrives.</seg>
<seg id="21">When a player is injured, say, or someone isn’t doing well and the team is struggling.</seg>
<seg id="22">There are so many different factors that have to come together so I could get that contract.</seg>
<seg id="23">But in New York at the moment the similar circumstances are arising, aren’t they?</seg>
<seg id="24">Rick Nash and Ryan Callahan are injured and the team didn't do well at the start of the season, so there is definitely a chance there, don’t you think?</seg>
<seg id="25">Of course, there’s always a chance.</seg>
<seg id="26">But the other thing is that you always need two sides for that.</seg>
<seg id="27">Today I’d take heaps of offers but so far I’ve not had any.</seg>
<seg id="28">That’s the reality, unfortunately, in which I have to live.</seg>
<seg id="29">On Friday you fly to America, are you expecting that something might just work out?</seg>
<seg id="30">I’ve had that expectation since 5 July, when the market with free players opened in the NHL, but there’s still nothing.</seg>
<seg id="31">Are you heading to New York, to remind them?</seg>
<seg id="32">Definitely not, I’m going to Tampa to see my children and wife.</seg>
<seg id="33">I’m looking forward to some sun and and seeing them again.</seg>
<seg id="34">Have you got a programme planned?</seg>
<seg id="35">That’s a given since I’m a father and husband and it all develops from there.</seg>
<seg id="36">At the moment I’m not a hockey player – I have no contract and I don’t play in matches.</seg>
<seg id="37">So I’ll fulfil my role of dad and husband and I'm really looking forward to it.</seg>
<seg id="38">This Sunday Vašík has two hockey matches, this is for me and all my family a holiday when we can go and support our children doing what they want to do.</seg>
<seg id="39">Do you think you could do that "full time"?</seg>
<seg id="40">Of course, you have to think of all sorts of things.</seg>
<seg id="41">That can happen too.</seg>
<seg id="42">I tried it three years ago when I missed 50 matches due to a knee operation.</seg>
<seg id="43">And I really, really loved it.</seg>
<seg id="44">One day you reach a stage where all the goals, wins and assists won’t replace what you have at home.</seg>
<seg id="45">Because family and children, that’s the meaning of life.</seg>
<seg id="46">Whatever work you want to do.</seg>
<seg id="47">I had the most beautiful work I could possibly have besides my family.</seg>
<seg id="48">You had a lot of offers from Europe: do you want to play NHL just because it’s the NHL or because of your family that you want to be in America?</seg>
<seg id="49">Since I’m a hockey player, so the first thing is – except for family – the sporting success.</seg>
<seg id="50">The NHL is the best competition in the world.</seg>
<seg id="51">And family life is dependent on that.</seg>
<seg id="52">My children, sorry, our children – mine and my wife’s – grew up in the States, they started school there and so on.</seg>
<seg id="53">And we would be really happy if they continued this trend.</seg>
<seg id="54">Because we won’t delude ourselves, in America the possibilities are completely somewhere else..</seg>
<seg id="55">We should offer them that chance.</seg>
<seg id="56">So do you plan to stay in America permanently?</seg>
<seg id="57">We’ll do what we have done so far.</seg>
<seg id="58">That means that in summer we’ll be in the Czech Republic in Hluboká and near České Budějovice.</seg>
<seg id="59">And in winter back in Tampa or wherever we end up.</seg>
<seg id="60">That’s absolutely ideal, to be always somewhere where it's warm.</seg>
<seg id="61">I’ve had a huge amount of luck in my life.</seg>
<seg id="62">It can be said that I went for it, it took a lot of strength and sacrifice and it took a lot of things away from me that I missed.</seg>
<seg id="63">But hockey offered me a lot of chances in return and this is one of them.</seg>
<seg id="64">That my wife and I can choose where we will live.</seg>
<seg id="65">There are many of people in this world who yearn for that, to be able to choose what they will do and how they will live.</seg>
<seg id="66">How long will you have the will to work hard, train hard and wait for an offer at your age?</seg>
<seg id="67">Well, that’s a question I can’t answer.</seg>
<seg id="68">I still have it in me now, the spirit, the desire, the enthusiasm, and the passion for the sport. The desire and motivation to show people that you can still be good enough the NHL, that I’m still better than someone else.</seg>
<seg id="69">But I can’t say for how long it will stay like that.</seg>
<seg id="70">You can’t plan that.</seg>
<seg id="71">So it can be said that you’ll wait this season to see how it works out and then you’ll decide what to do next?</seg>
<seg id="72">I’m at the stage where I go from day to day.</seg>

<seg id="1">Greenpeace activists detained in Russia are transported to St Petersburg</seg>
<seg id="2">Environmental activists detained since September in Russia due to a protest against the planned oil production in the Arctic have been airlifted from Murmansk to St Petersburg.</seg>
<seg id="3">The AFP agency reported this today, referring to the international environmental organisation Greenpeace.</seg>
<seg id="4">It also says that the activists’ original charges of piracy have not yet been withdrawn.</seg>
<seg id="5">"Greenpeace International understands from diplomatic sources that the thirty men and women detained by Russia following a peaceful protest against an Arctic oil platform are being moved from a detention centre in Murmansk to a jail in St Petersburg," reported the organisation in a statement.</seg>
<seg id="6">The reasons for moving the detained activists are not clear; according to the DPA agency it was a planned move.</seg>
<seg id="7">The authorities initially accused the environmentalists of piracy, for which, in the event of conviction, they would face up to 15 years in prison.</seg>
<seg id="8">However, last week it was announced that this would be replaced with a more moderate charge of hooliganism, for which they would face a reduced sentence with a maximum sentence of seven years.</seg>
<seg id="9">In today’s statement, however, Greenpeace pointed out that the piracy charge had not yet been withdrawn as promised.</seg>
<seg id="10">Reportedly, this means that the detainees are now accused of two offences.</seg>
<seg id="11">The powerful Investigative Committee last week announced that the piracy charge would be replaced with the hooliganism charge.</seg>
<seg id="12">But when the thirty prisoners stood before the committee this week, the piracy charge was not dropped.</seg>
<seg id="13">Instead each of them was served with the additional charge," said AFP, quoting the Greenpeace statement.</seg>
<seg id="14">In mid-September, Russia detained thirty members of Greenpeace from 18 countries at a Gazprom oil rig.</seg>
<seg id="15">The environmentalists were on the ship Arctic Sunrise, which was sailing under a Dutch flag.</seg>
<seg id="16">Since then, they have all been held in custody, against which they did file an appeal, but the court rejected them all.</seg>
<seg id="17">The environmentalists have complained about conditions in prison.</seg>
<seg id="18">According to AFP, Greenpeace’s executive director Kumi Naidoo said today that the move to St Petersburg would make it easier for the detainees to meet with their families and consular staff.</seg>
<seg id="19">However, there are no guarantees that the conditions in the new prison will be better than in Murmansk.</seg>
<seg id="20">"They could in fact be worse," she warned.</seg>
<seg id="21">Faiza Oulahsen, one of the detained activists, asked Dutch King Willem-Alexander for help.</seg>
<seg id="22">In a handwritten letter, published today by the newspaper Algemeen Dagblad, she urged the monarch to discuss their situation during a planned meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin.</seg>

<seg id="1">Ostrava’s Mayor Kajnar: I am not the cancer in the Czech Social Democratic Party (ČSSD)</seg>
<seg id="2">Before the election, a long-smouldering dispute between two wings fighting for influence within the Ostrava branch of ČSSD was fully ignited.</seg>
<seg id="3">It all culminated when Ostrava mayor Petr Kajnar took court action due to the undemocratic assembly of lists of candidates.</seg>
<seg id="4">Players in the affair still did not want to say much on the matter, so as not to harm the party even more prior to the election.</seg>
<seg id="5">Now, however, the votes have already been counted.</seg>
<seg id="6">The leadership of Ostrava’s ČSSD therefore urged the mayor of Ostrava on Monday evening to stand down from the party, and they will probably push so that he will lose his post.</seg>
<seg id="7">But Petr Kajnar wants to fight on.</seg>
<seg id="8">In an exclusive interview for Deník, he has described what the disputes are about and who is on whose side.</seg>
<seg id="9">How do you feel about the outcome of the election?</seg>
<seg id="10">The ČSSD was certainly expecting a much better result.</seg>
<seg id="11">Was it harmed here by the inner-party disputes being discussed in the media prior to the election?</seg>
<seg id="12">I can imagine that social democracy party could have had a better outcome in the election.</seg>
<seg id="13">But on the other hand, it reflects the state the ČSSD is now in.</seg>
<seg id="14">It is a party which has its internal issues, it is sick inside and people can see that things are not all right.</seg>
<seg id="15">They made that clear in the election.</seg>
<seg id="16">What are these internal illnesses in the ČSSD?</seg>
<seg id="17">The ODS has already been going through a decline for some time, in my view, and similar things are now happening unfortunately in social democracy party.</seg>
<seg id="18">The fact is that lobbyists, influential people, who previously expected to find their prebends with the ODS, have shifted to people in the ČSSD and have an influence on them.</seg>
<seg id="19">It is then related to the police searching through the offices of the Ostrava municipal authority and collecting computers.</seg>
<seg id="20">It shows that the ČSSD is not just made up of people who want good for all the others, but that many of them think primarily of their own good.</seg>
<seg id="21">The ČSSD is split into two irreconcilable camps in Prague too, as can also be seen in the current power struggle between Hašek’s and Sobotka’s supporters.</seg>
<seg id="22">But that has been in preparation for a long time too.</seg>
<seg id="23">What happened before the election in Ostrava was just a precursor to what is now happening in Prague.</seg>
<seg id="24">Hašek’s wing gradually occupied the positions so that after the election it could provoke a situation which would weaken Sobotka’s wing.</seg>
<seg id="25">In politics, you are in a situation where you sometimes have to accept compromises.</seg>
<seg id="26">But everyone has their own internal limit beyond which it is not possible to make compromises, and that is also my case.</seg>
<seg id="27">Originally I did not want to run for the chamber, but when I saw all that was going on in the party, I made an agreement with Luboš Zaorálek that I would try and get on the regional list of candidates, so that as the mayor of Ostrava I could actually strengthen Sobotka’s wing.</seg>
<seg id="28">However, Hašek’s wing put a stop to that.</seg>
<seg id="29">Why are you on the side of Bohuslav Sobotka, and not on the side of Michal Hašek?</seg>
<seg id="30">I think that Slávek Sobotka is the person who always talks first of all about the ČSSD programme and to a certain extent  also about the visions concerning the party and this country.</seg>
<seg id="31">I admit that I haven’t heard anything of the sort from the other side.</seg>
<seg id="32">Michal Hašek is just fighting for power.</seg>
<seg id="33">I don’t understand how can the presidium, which is a lower authority than the central executive committee, start with just removing the party chairman.</seg>
<seg id="34">That is a power struggle regardless of anything and it is against the party statutes.</seg>
<seg id="35">In my opinion, what Michal Hašek has displayed in Prague has ended his political career.</seg>
<seg id="36">How do you view the fact that the Ostrava leadership of the ČSSD did not approve you for the list of candidates?</seg>
<seg id="37">Political parties are based on competition, who takes what place from their members.</seg>
<seg id="38">The competition should mainly be based on programme visions and the capabilities of the people to fulfil those visions.</seg>
<seg id="39">Of course, there are people who also enter this competition who do not have much in the way of ability or vision, but the political party is  for them a lift towards the money they would not get elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="40">The problem is, when these people start to get to the fore thanks to their breaking the rules unscrupulously, they breach the party statutes.</seg>
<seg id="41">With their practices, they turn political parties into the mafias and in my opinion they are therefore also breaking the Czech laws.</seg>
<seg id="42">It is more important to me to point out this problem than to take into consideration whether or not Kajnar has some sort of political future.</seg>
<seg id="43">It is important for the parties to start respecting the statutes.</seg>
<seg id="44">Is that why you filed a petition to the court then before the election for an injunction against the form of the list of the ČSSD candidates in the Moravian Silesian Region?</seg>
<seg id="45">The current district executive committee of the ČSSD in Ostrava is strengthening its power by shutting down organisations that do not satisfy it, purposefully founding new organisations, and gradually getting rid of inconvenient party members.</seg>
<seg id="46">For example, the fact is that they wanted to exclude Richard Bednařík from the representatives club, but he brought an action against it and they then instead cancelled their resolution about his exclusion.</seg>
<seg id="47">This shows that demanding adherence to party statutes through the courts may be the last option, but when the other methods and inspection authorities inside the ČSSD have stopped working, it is the only option.</seg>
<seg id="48">The leadership of the Ostrava’s ČSSD headed by Adam Rykala is attempting to remove you from the post of mayor.</seg>
<seg id="49">It is an open secret that Poruba’s mayor, Lumír Palyza, is itching for this post.</seg>
<seg id="50">It’s true, Adam Rykala and Lumír Palyza are trying to do everything they can to remove me.</seg>
<seg id="51">They are promising posts to the people, gaining the votes and for these votes they are strengthening their power in the party.</seg>
<seg id="52">When I go back to the past, then everything that happened around the football club Baník Ostrava, for example, and the purchase of the Bazaly Stadium, it was just an excuse for them to attack me.</seg>
<seg id="53">It was artfully staged so they could label me as someone who puts money where it doesn’t belong.</seg>
<seg id="54">At the same time, the city bought the property which has a high strategic value for them.</seg>
<seg id="55">So how do you envisage what will happen next in your remaining in the post of the mayor?</seg>
<seg id="56">The district committee already called upon me and some other people on Monday to consider whether to remain in the ČSSD.</seg>
<seg id="57">But I think it is like a thief shouting: Catch the thief!</seg>
<seg id="58">When we look at the results of my work in the last eleven years, I don’t see anyone in the  Ostrava’s Social Democratic Party who would initiate and enforce, sometimes even against party members, the creation of so many developments, such as industrial zones or expanding the science and technology park.</seg>
<seg id="59">Despite everything, I am becoming inconvenient.</seg>
<seg id="60">I don’t read it differently than I’m in the way of others fighting their way to the posts they long for.</seg>
<seg id="61">Will you continue to fight against these attempts?</seg>
<seg id="62">Because if this republic is meant to work well, the political parties must also work well.</seg>
<seg id="63">I can hardly believe that any party can effectively manage a country when it cannot even manage itself.</seg>
<seg id="64">So I’m not considering leaving the ČSSD now, because I think that I am not the one causing this party’s cancer, it’s the people who are trying to drive me out.</seg>

<seg id="2">The organiser of the Olomouc Christmas markets and ice skating, Pavel Spálený, said that the planned work on the ice rink began on 26 October and from Wednesday ice making machine has been operating.</seg>
<seg id="3">The ice layer is already seven centimetres thick and by Friday morning the surface will be ready for the first visitors.</seg>
<seg id="4">The ice rink has an area of 375 square metres, the platform has taken up 358 square metres.</seg>
<seg id="5">Skaters and passers-by will also have two stalls with punch at their disposal.</seg>
<seg id="6">"We have extended the floor area, increased the space in front of the stalls and almost all of the platform area is covered so the skaters can change their shoes in comfort," said Spálený.</seg>
<seg id="7">The streets of Olomouc are already reminiscent of the coming Christmas.</seg>
<seg id="8">Last year, the ice rink was installed directly in front of the main entrance to the town hall on the square Horní Náměstí, due to the repairs on the square Dolní Náměstí.</seg>
<seg id="9">Dolní Náměstí repairs were completed in late summer, so the ice rink could return to its original location.</seg>
<seg id="10">People could first skate right in front of the town hall in 2009, when the ice rink was in operation from January to March.</seg>
<seg id="11">The ice rink then became an integral part of the Christmas markets in the city.</seg>
<seg id="12">The Christmas markets, which include a rich cultural programme, will be launched on Horní Náměstí a month before Christmas Eve.</seg>

<seg id="1">Brutal murder of elderly man in the Zlín region to be dealt with again by regional court</seg>
<seg id="2">The regional court dismissed charges against a 25 year old Slovak and a 22 year old Czech due to lack of evidence.</seg>
<seg id="3">The men denied guilt.</seg>
<seg id="4">They face 15 to 20 years in prison or even an exceptional punishment.</seg>
<seg id="5">Spokesman Petr Angyalossy confirmed that the high court had annulled the regional ruling and returned the case to be heard again.</seg>
<seg id="6">He refused to comment on the reasons which led the judge to this, saying that the ruling had not yet been served on the parties.</seg>
<seg id="7">According to the prosecution, the young men attacked the 77 year old man in his home.</seg>
<seg id="8">The elderly man died an agonising death.</seg>
<seg id="9">According to the prosecution, they strangled the man, beat and kicked him all over his body, and also, using a metal object, probably a gas pistol, inflicted around thirty blows to the head.</seg>
<seg id="10">The man suffered serious injuries, for example skull fractures, swelling of the brain and bleeding in the brain, causing him to die on the spot.</seg>
<seg id="11">The young men allegedly took around 3,000 crowns from the house, and jewellery worth around 14,000 crowns.</seg>
<seg id="12">According to the regional court, the only and, moreover, circumstantial evidence against the defendants were scent traces, which an expert assessed as not fully detected in terms of statutory guidelines.</seg>
<seg id="13">Scent traces from the scene of the crime and on other items in more than ten cases matched the defendants, but the police treated them as material traces, not scent traces, at first.</seg>
<seg id="14">In addition, certain errors handling the traces were found.</seg>
<seg id="15">According to the court, the defendants’ guilt was not proven beyond doubt.</seg>
<seg id="16">However, the court admitted that the police had very difficult conditions.</seg>
<seg id="17">The dead elderly man with his skull broken was found by relatives who thought he had probably fallen and injured himself.</seg>
<seg id="18">A doctor from the emergency services who was called out did not alert them to the violent death either.</seg>
<seg id="19">Only after several days were detectives contacted by Olomouc doctors, who found signs of a violent death during the autopsy.</seg>
<seg id="20">The police could no longer work with all the traces from the scene of the crime, which had been cleaned up by relatives.</seg>
<seg id="21">None of the defendants’ DNA was found at the scene.</seg>
<seg id="22">The young Slovak lived in the Uherské Hradiště area.</seg>
<seg id="23">He is now serving a sentence of 8.5 years, which was definitively confirmed last year by the Olomouc High Court.</seg>
<seg id="24">According to the court, the man was the head of an organised group of six young men who were responsible for robbing jewellery shops.</seg>
<seg id="25">The robberies took place in October and November of 2011, shortly after the murder of the old man in Slopné.</seg>
<seg id="26">The younger defendant in the murder of the elderly man lives in Uherské Hradiště.</seg>
<seg id="27">In August, the court released him from prison after 11 months.</seg>

<seg id="2">Dagmar Damková, chairperson of the referees’ committee of the Football Association of the Czech Republic (FACR), has stopped publishing punishments for referees.</seg>
<seg id="3">UEFA regulations ban her from doing so, which she revealed in an interview with the Právo newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="4">Otherwise the FACR could reportedly be penalised.</seg>
<seg id="5">Damková also denied that she is biased in her job towards footballers from Plzen, where she is from.</seg>
<seg id="6">These speculations are absolute nonsense.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is true that I live in Plzen, but other committee members are from elsewhere, for example Prague as well.</seg>
<seg id="8">So in the case of voting, I could lose 1-6," said Damková in response to criticism that arose after Plzen had twice as many penalties recently as other league teams.</seg>
<seg id="9">Although in the last few months FACR has stopped publishing punishments for referees, Damková offers assurance that referees do pay for their mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="10">"Trust me, if the committee finds out that an official has made a mistake, his assignments are cut down, whatever the game was," said Damková.</seg>
<seg id="11">The reason why punishments are not published is, according to Damková, a ban from the European football union.</seg>
<seg id="12">"UEFA bans the publishing of this sort of information and violations are severely punished."</seg>
<seg id="13">"Here we are very suspicious and we look for something in every mistake."</seg>
<seg id="14">"We did publish restrictions, but I received two very strong warnings that if we didn’t stop we would get heavy penalties," said Damková.</seg>
<seg id="15">Other countries respect the ban.</seg>
<seg id="16">"We were really the exception," she added.</seg>
<seg id="17">If she had continued to publish information, the committee could reportedly lose money from UEFA for the education and development of referees.</seg>
<seg id="18">"And that is very important for us."</seg>
<seg id="19">"Without that we could not carry out the referees training programme," added Damková.</seg>

<seg id="2">Head of Public affairs Vít Bárta was arrested by police on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="3">The head of the analytics and informatics division of the anti-corruption police Jan Petržílek was also arrested with him.</seg>
<seg id="4">The arrest is linked to the wiretapping of lobbyist Roman Janoušek and former mayor Pavel Bém (ODS).</seg>
<seg id="5">The information about the wiretapping, which was brought by the server Novinky.cz, was confirmed to the Czech News Agency by a reliable source.</seg>
<seg id="6">The tapped phone calls of Janoušek and Bém, published last March by the newspaper Mladá Fronta Dnes and in which both men call each other "Pampered boy" and "Hummingbird", demonstrate Janoušek’s influence on the city’s actions under Bém’s leadership.</seg>
<seg id="7">The paper then said that the Security Information Service (BIS) obtained them in 2007, from which two years later they were leaked to the ABL Security Agency.</seg>
<seg id="8">This was owned by Bárta at the time.</seg>
<seg id="9">The server Novinky.cz pointed out that the arrested investigator Petržílek used to work for BIS before starting work for the anti-corruption police.</seg>

<seg id="1">Six out of ten firms are preparing for the new Civil Code</seg>
<seg id="2">Six out of ten firms are preparing intensively for the impending new Civil Code and the Act on Business Corporations which come into effect on 1 January 2014.</seg>
<seg id="3">Only eight per cent of business representatives questioned said that they were not tackling matters related to both key codes in their companies.</seg>
<seg id="4">This is according to a survey by the law office Ambruz & Dark Deloitte Legal, which surveyed the opinions of 108 Czech businesses.</seg>
<seg id="5">In relation to the approaching date of effectiveness of both key codes, only now at the last minute many managers are starting to realise the significant impact they may have on the running of their companies.</seg>
<seg id="6">The biggest changes in private law in the last 50 years, in our opinion, are in fact going to affect every citizen and business in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="7">Due to politicians’ manoeuvring, the business sector has long lived in uncertainty as to whether or not the revolutionary changes would eventually happen.</seg>
<seg id="8">"Now, however, they only have a few weeks left for the transfer to the new law to take place without any complications for their firms," said Ambruz & Dark Deloitte Legal partner Jan Spáčil on the results.</seg>
<seg id="9">Out of 61 per cent of companies dealing intensively with the new codes, 26 per cent said that their firms had already taken all the necessary measures to be prepared in time.</seg>
<seg id="10">In addition, 35 per cent of companies out of this number plan to take the necessary measures in the next few days.</seg>
<seg id="11">On the other hand, every fifth company has not yet dealt with the recodification, but has a definite idea of how to prepare for it.</seg>
<seg id="12">A total of 11 per cent has no opinion and cannot judge the issue.</seg>
<seg id="13">Only eight per cent of companies admitted they had not yet addressed the issues related to recodification.</seg>
<seg id="14">The most important legal topic connected to with the new civil code is for the most companies surveyed the signing of new contracts (21 per cent), followed by handling resolving business terms and conditions (16 per cent) and then changes in the Land Registry and in liability for damage (ten per cent each).</seg>
<seg id="15">As regards, contracts, one of the most important new features of the whole recodification is the unification of the form of the contracts only according the new Civil Code.</seg>
<seg id="16">The current parallel amendment of the Civil and Commercial Codes will expire, as a result of which the contract law should become clearer for both citizens and businesses.</seg>
<seg id="17">"In the case of businesses, the new amendment offers a lot of new features with emphasis on greater freedom in organising relationships," said Lukáš Poddaný, a lawyer at Ambruz & Dark Deloitte Legal.</seg>
<seg id="18">In relation to the Business Corporations Act, almost a quarter of companies regard the most important topic to be the issue of increasing responsibility of statutory authorities.</seg>
<seg id="19">This is followed by topics concerning changes in convening and running general assembly meetings (15 per cent) and representing the company (14 per cent).</seg>
<seg id="20">The new legislation means the tightening up of obligations and possible impacts for statutory authorities, especially in the situation where a company is in danger of going or goes bankrupt.</seg>
<seg id="21">"In practice this means that if members of boards of directors and company secretaries do not act with due diligence and do not avert the threat of the company’s bankruptcy, they could lose the benefit obtained from performing their duty for up to the last two years," added Spáčil.</seg>

<seg id="1">Trekking through mud, rivers and jungle to provide free medical care</seg>
<seg id="2">Dr. Georges Bwelle is bringing free health care to rural villages in Cameroon</seg>
<seg id="3">Bwelle and his team spend almost every weekend seeing hundreds of patients</seg>
<seg id="4">There aren't many doctors in the west African country; just one for every 5,000 people</seg>
<seg id="5">Cast your vote here or through your mobile device</seg>
<seg id="6">Dr. Georges Bwelle is one of the top 10 CNN Heroes of 2013.</seg>
<seg id="7">You can vote for him, or any of the other top 10 Heroes, to be CNN Hero of the Year.</seg>
<seg id="8">That person will receive $250,000 to continue their extraordinary work.</seg>
<seg id="9">For 21 years, Georges Bwelle watched his ill father slip in and out of consciousness, traveling to hospitals that weren't equipped to help him.</seg>
<seg id="10">Jamef Bwelle was injured in a 1981 car accident near Yaounde, Cameroon's capital.</seg>
<seg id="11">He suffered only a broken arm at first, but an infection developed and spread to his brain, creating a hematoma that would affect him for the rest of his life.</seg>
<seg id="12">"There were no neurosurgeons in Cameroon," Georges Bwelle said.</seg>
<seg id="13">We would have taken him out of Cameroon if we had the money.</seg>
<seg id="14">Instead, Bwelle spent years escorting his father to overcrowded clinics and hospitals, getting whatever treatment they could get.</seg>
<seg id="15">"It's not easy," Bwelle said.</seg>
<seg id="16">You can leave home at 5 a.m., running to the hospital to be the first, and you are not the first.</seg>
<seg id="17">There are a lot of patients.</seg>
<seg id="18">Some people can die because they are waiting.</seg>
<seg id="19">The situation hasn't changed much since Bwelle's father passed away in 2002.</seg>
<seg id="20">In Cameroon, there is only one doctor for every 5,000 people, according to the World Health Organization.</seg>
<seg id="21">For comparison's sake, the ratio in the United States is one doctor for every 413 people.</seg>
<seg id="22">And even if they could see a physician, many Cameroonians couldn't afford it.</seg>
<seg id="23">Two out of five people in the country live below the poverty line, and nearly three-quarters of the country's health-care spending is private.</seg>
<seg id="24">"The only problem they have is poverty," Bwelle said.</seg>
<seg id="25">And with poverty, they cannot enjoy their life.</seg>
<seg id="26">Seeing his father and so many of his countrymen suffer, Bwelle was determined to do something about it.</seg>
<seg id="27">Dr. Georges Bwelle and his team of volunteers have performed 700 free surgeries in the past year.</seg>
<seg id="28">He became a doctor himself, working as a vascular surgeon in Yaounde's Central Hospital.</seg>
<seg id="29">And he started a nonprofit, ASCOVIME, that travels into rural areas on weekends to provide free medical care.</seg>
<seg id="30">Since 2008, he and his group of volunteers have helped nearly 32,000 people.</seg>
<seg id="31">Almost every Friday, he and up to 30 people jam into vans, tie medical supplies to the roofs and travel across rough terrain to visit villages in need.</seg>
<seg id="32">Their luck doesn't always hold out.</seg>
<seg id="33">They've had to push vehicles through rivers and mud more than once.</seg>
<seg id="34">But when they arrive, they receive a true heroes' welcome: a feast, singing and dancing, and the best accommodations the community can offer.</seg>
<seg id="35">In these villages, free medical care is truly a cause for celebration, and Bwelle -- with his big smile and boundless energy -- is more than happy to join in the fun.</seg>
<seg id="36">The next morning, the team begins meeting with hundreds of patients.</seg>
<seg id="37">"We are receiving 500 people in each trip," Bwelle said.</seg>
<seg id="38">They are coming from 60 kilometers around the village, and they're coming on foot.</seg>
<seg id="39">Each of these weekend clinics provides a variety of medical care.</seg>
<seg id="40">Many people are treated for malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasites and sexually transmitted diseases.</seg>
<seg id="41">Others might receive crutches, a pair of donated eyeglasses or free birth certificates -- documentation that's required for school but that many impoverished families simply can't afford.</seg>
<seg id="42">In the evenings, the team will do simple surgeries with local anesthesia.</seg>
<seg id="43">Operations are usually done in a schoolhouse, town hall or home; after the procedure, patients get up and walk to the recovery area to make way for the next person.</seg>
<seg id="44">With the group's generator lighting the operating room and sanitizing equipment, Bwelle and his volunteers work into the early hours of Sunday morning.</seg>
<seg id="45">It's a backbreaking pace, but village musicians usually help keep the team motivated.</seg>
<seg id="46">"They are beating drums all night to keep us awake and continue our work," Bwelle said.</seg>
<seg id="47">On Sunday, the team heads back to the city, tired but proud of their work.</seg>
<seg id="48">The group -- a mix of Cameroonian doctors and foreign medical students -- has performed 700 free surgeries in the past year, and they know that their help can make a world of difference to those they help.</seg>
<seg id="49">One man explained that the free hernia surgery he'd received will allow him to work again.</seg>
<seg id="50">"This will change my future with my family," the man said.</seg>
<seg id="51">In addition to holding these weekend clinics and working as a hospital surgeon, Bwelle also works nights at private medical clinics around Yaounde.</seg>
<seg id="52">It's this second job, he said, that funds about 60% of his nonprofit; the rest is covered by private donations.</seg>
<seg id="53">"I'm not sure when he sleeps," said Katie O'Malley, a second-year medical student from Drexel University in Philadelphia and volunteer with Bwelle's group.</seg>
<seg id="54">He is always either at the hospital or trying to make money for the organization so he can go on these campaigns.</seg>
<seg id="55">For medical and nursing students such as O'Malley, who come from the United States and Europe to join Bwelle on his missions, it's a hands-on opportunity they'd never get at home.</seg>
<seg id="56">"We've been able to scrub in on surgeries where we help blot blood away or hold tools for Dr. Bwelle," O'Malley said.</seg>
<seg id="57">That's not something you'd ever get to do in America as a second-year medical student.</seg>
<seg id="58">The student volunteers usually pay their own way to Cameroon, often arriving with donated medical supplies.</seg>
<seg id="59">But once they arrive in Yaounde, their board, transportation and instruction are covered by Bwelle.</seg>
<seg id="60">"He's a hero, without a doubt," O'Malley said.</seg>
<seg id="61">He gives his life to this organization, and his desire to help the Cameroon people is everlasting.</seg>
<seg id="62">For Bwelle, the near-constant workload isn't a hardship.</seg>
<seg id="63">Helping others live happier lives, fulfilling a promise he made to his father, is something that brings him great joy.</seg>
<seg id="64">"I am so happy when I am doing this work," Bwelle said.</seg>
<seg id="65">And I think about my father.</seg>
<seg id="66">I hope he sees what I am doing.</seg>
<seg id="67">To make people laugh, to reduce the pain, that's why I'm doing this.</seg>

<seg id="1">Minister Holcát restores post of Chief Nurse for the Czech Republic</seg>
<seg id="2">The Chief Nurse for the Czech Republic should represent the interests of nurses, whose numbers in the Czech Republic exceed 100,000.</seg>
<seg id="3">"I consider it essential that this post is clearly defined and formalised so nurses have their own representative within the official structure – an official to whom they can always turn to if they need to," explains Martin Holcát, Minister of Health.</seg>
<seg id="4">I value the work of nurses and I think that the nursing profession deserves to be given sufficient attention by the Ministry as well.</seg>
<seg id="5">In performing this profession, you need not only a high level of professionalism, but also a human touch and personal conviction.</seg>
<seg id="6">"I will gladly and with all responsibility try to promote those steps that can improve the position of nurses."</seg>
<seg id="7">"We have excellent and skilled nurses in our healthcare system, but I would like to appeal to those colleagues who do not help us with their approach to patients, to perform their job with all the empathy and help us to improve the image of nurses in the eyes of the public," says Alena Šmídová.</seg>
<seg id="8">The newly appointed Chief Nurse for the Czech Republic Alena Šmídová on the occasion of taking office also said that she would like to deal with the various aspects of the job of nurse and plans to also work with professional associations, specialist societies, educators, other non-medical professions and doctors.</seg>
<seg id="9">"Fundamentally, I do not want to separate the jobs of doctors and nurses, but on the contrary I see them standing side by side, with each of them having their competence, and together with other medical professionals creating a coordinated working team which provides healthcare services to the benefit of the patient."</seg>
<seg id="10">"I myself come across a range of problems that occur in the nursing profession; I see these difficulties and I intend to contribute to resolving them."</seg>
<seg id="11">This include, for example, ensuring the simplification of nursing and medical documentation.</seg>
<seg id="12">"From my own experience I know that some administrative tasks are an unnecessary burden for nurses and takes up time they could and should be devoting to patients," says Alena Šmídová.</seg>
<seg id="13">Other areas she intends to focus on include improving working conditions, looking for ways to improve cooperation in teams and with the managements of healthcare providers, revising competencies and also labour and legal issues, such as adhering to the Labour Code and not overloading nurses given their insufficient numbers at a given time and place.</seg>
<seg id="14">We often hear anonymous complaints, which however for fear of possible sanctions, are not documented as a specific case, where there may be a breach of regulations.</seg>
<seg id="15">"If there’s no plaintiff, there’s no judge, so the post of Chief Nurse for the Czech Republic could in this case serve as a guarantee of retaining anonymity for such complaints and a have a specific case investigated by the relevant authorities," concludes Alena Šmídová.</seg>
<seg id="16">Mgr. Alena Šmídová studied at the Secondary School of Nursing taking the nursing course (she graduated in 1978) and in the Arts Faculty at Charles University in Prague in the programme Nursing – Education (she graduated in 1992).</seg>
<seg id="17">Since 2010, she has been the head of the department for nursing and other non-medical professions and recognition of qualifications in the Department of Education and Science at the Ministry of Health of the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="18">During her professional career, she has worked as a bedside nurse in an internal ward, and has also worked as a teacher at the Secondary School of Nursing, where she was also the statutory representative of the director for 8 years.</seg>
<seg id="19">Between 2004 and 2009 she worked as the Chief Nurse for the Prison Service of the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="20">She has published several specialist nursing textbooks and articles in professional magazines, and delivered lectures in the field of nursing.</seg>
<seg id="21">She is not a member of any political party.</seg>

<seg id="1">So I wouldn't choke myself with hate</seg>
<seg id="2">Author Václav Kahuda has returned to writing after twelve years.</seg>
<seg id="3">After many years in which he read, lived, but did not write, VÁCLAV KAHUDA (1965) has published a new novel entitled Wind, Dark, Presence.</seg>
<seg id="4">The number of pages, comparable with that of his best known work, Thicket (Petrov, 2001), indicates it will not be a slender volume.</seg>
<seg id="5">Kahuda was interviewed by another significant Czech writer today – Emil Hakl – for Salon.</seg>
<seg id="6">What moved you to write a novel after twelve years of silence?</seg>
<seg id="7">I did it so I wouldn't choke myself with hate.</seg>
<seg id="8">To keep seeing new clones of people’s foolish triviality all around me, young organisms affected by blind, selfish endeavour.</seg>
<seg id="9">Not to say anything about us older people, faces ruined by helpless lust, the racketeering souls of racketeers, the ideologists with reversed polarity, who try to sell their "product" with the expression of a young whore.</seg>
<seg id="10">At the start of new millennium, I bought myself a small digital camera and filmed my God-fearing friends, freaks and hidden groups.</seg>
<seg id="11">I got over that.</seg>
<seg id="12">Sometimes I feel my brain is on fire from life on this planet.</seg>
<seg id="13">I’m happiest taking walks and in the evening reading books by lamplight.</seg>
<seg id="14">You talk about a feeling of frustration, of hate.</seg>
<seg id="15">Was there some sort of turning point in your past that affected you, or are you just getting old like the rest of us?</seg>
<seg id="16">That turning point occurred a long time ago, when I was around ten years old.</seg>
<seg id="17">There was no name for it at the time.</seg>
<seg id="18">Hm, and then I lived.</seg>
<seg id="19">But somewhere inside there is still a surprised, quiet boy.</seg>
<seg id="20">I see another orphaned bastard, each in his tornado of anxiety.</seg>
<seg id="21">Writing books saved me.</seg>
<seg id="22">I’m taking part in this huge, thousand years lasting movement of the system of life on this planet – in the birth of an unfathomable future.</seg>
<seg id="23">The vast, breathtaking complexity of life, where every stone is a direct heir of our present.</seg>
<seg id="24">We are the players of a sad and beautiful game, where through trial and error, more and more generations of beings are created, which in billions of interactions per second creates a sort of superhuman, artificial intelligence.</seg>
<seg id="25">Twelve years is quite a long time.</seg>
<seg id="26">Do you see your writing as an ongoing process or have you started right from scratch?</seg>
<seg id="27">The monologue, or rather the dialogue between the right and left halves of the brain sometimes rises to the surface and forms a book.</seg>
<seg id="28">Just as the periods of peace are interwoven with quietly sleeping metastases of wars which may wake up one day, my book is twelve years of silence dressed in words.</seg>
<seg id="29">I felt a wordless avalanche of life growing in my brain, and if I don’t do anything, one day it will silently bury me.</seg>
<seg id="30">It is a set of questions formulated by the brain and it puts them in layers stored in the dark "below the surface of consciousness".</seg>
<seg id="31">The neocortex, the grey cerebral cortex, questions older evolutionary formations, it goes towards ancient growth rings of the cerebral tree.</seg>
<seg id="32">It talks to hairy beasts, questions snakes, looks for answers in the flight of birds, lifts its gaze to the clouds in the sky.</seg>
<seg id="33">Yes, moral law in me and the starry sky above me.</seg>
<seg id="34">In the end the brain questions the world.</seg>
<seg id="35">You express the ego metaphorically relatively often – could you define it biologically?</seg>
<seg id="36">The brain keeps, in its billions of connections and electrochemical links, all the memories and experiences the person concerned has gone through.</seg>
<seg id="37">This forest of logically and emotionally exposed and branching trees of information, the registers of memory, uses the brain in its distinguishing, cognitive process, being exposed to a constantly changing present, in a continuous effort trying to name and understand its surroundings and decode important messages.</seg>
<seg id="38">Sometimes faults occur due to an overload.</seg>
<seg id="39">By analogy – like your computer "crashing", from a program for a speech emulator and translator of foreign languages, you would first get entangled in the operating environment, Windows, for example, and after several unsuccessful restarts, you would end up with a dark green blinking Bios screen, in the base system which controls functions and cooperation on the motherboard between the processor and operating memory, etc.</seg>
<seg id="40">For those who still haven’t worked out what this is about – I’m talking about a psychospiritual crisis.</seg>
<seg id="41">You often mention it – why is it this type of regression that interests you periodically?</seg>
<seg id="42">Because it is a pitfall.</seg>
<seg id="43">In the still functional mechanisms of our thinking, feeling and behaviour, there appears a gap.</seg>
<seg id="44">It is good to quote Nietzsche here: "When you gaze long into an abyss, the abyss also gazes into you."</seg>
<seg id="45">A pure feeling – that a man is lost if all hope disappears, he psychically "dies" and a new quality sets in.</seg>
<seg id="46">And why does it interest me personally?</seg>
<seg id="47">I’ll answer with a parable.</seg>
<seg id="48">A man once fell into a pool and was drowning; days, months and years went by, he was still drowning and at the same time ha was reading, and those books taught him to swim – and therefore live.</seg>
<seg id="49">He became a "diver".</seg>
<seg id="50">Perhaps one sentence written by me will help someone, just as Hrabal’s texts once helped me.</seg>
<seg id="51">To what extent do you think of the reader, of a specific person who will read your text?</seg>
<seg id="52">The one about whom you cannot say anything meaningful, some call it psyche, others super-ego,  but in my opinion it was best characterised by Arthur Rimbaud in a letter to a friend:</seg>
<seg id="53">"I is someone else – this reader is directly involved in the process of formulating words and sentences."</seg>
<seg id="54">From an early age, he read books of old Czech fairy tales, sailed in Captain Nemo’s submarine, ran around the dark alleys of the shadowlands.</seg>
<seg id="55">Still, in the end, behind all this ramifying by authors and their message, it says: "Bright suns of other worlds by Karel Hynek Mácha".</seg>
<seg id="56">And when the book out is?</seg>
<seg id="57">Do you care about the reader’s opinion?</seg>
<seg id="58">The reflections that reach you through the people who read the book?</seg>
<seg id="59">Of course I care about the opinion of people who take 300 crowns and are willing to read 500 pages of text.</seg>
<seg id="60">And then, maybe years later, they contact me randomly on the street and thank me that I helped them with my book in some difficult life decision they had to make.</seg>
<seg id="61">Books are in fact "lives" or, put it better. "worlds".</seg>
<seg id="62">They are coded in symbols of letters, they carry the experience, the history of regions of that or another language.</seg>
<seg id="63">At any time we can bring them to life, when we let their sentences flow into the brain.</seg>
<seg id="64">It is actually, in its way, something forbidden, divine – to wake up more and more life stories, small universes and temporary planets.</seg>
<seg id="65">It is a fact whose DNA is stored in lines – according to old demonology books we commit witchcraft.</seg>
<seg id="66">After publishing the book – as tends to happen – a string of readings will await you.</seg>
<seg id="67">I remember you once liked reading.</seg>
<seg id="68">Are you going to throw yourself into it again with joy, or do you feel differently after many years?</seg>
<seg id="69">Now I just prefer talking.</seg>
<seg id="70">And what have I discovered doing this?</seg>
<seg id="71">There are good, intelligent people living everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="72">Their basic characteristic – they are discreet, they don’t draw too much attention to themselves, they are friendly, you don’t feel alone with them.</seg>
<seg id="73">I’ll give an example – in the town of Červený Kostelec there once lived (and I hope he still lives) a curly-haired bookseller (aptly named Červenka), a cheerful companion and a real ladies’ man.</seg>
<seg id="74">One time, when boozing, he presented to me the individual parts from a range of readers of my book Thicket.</seg>
<seg id="75">I looked them in the eyes and then I was shown a tattered, worn copy of my book.</seg>
<seg id="76">Embarrassed, I put the just-read sausage of a book down and wept briefly with masculine tears.</seg>
<seg id="77">We all stood there silently, swaying and weeping, drunk with emotion.</seg>
<seg id="78">Then this young, blond, mixed race guy couldn’t take it any longer and, with a roar, jumped out of the window head first into a snow drift.</seg>
<seg id="79">It was on the ground floor.</seg>
<seg id="80">We ran out into the night landscape and, overcome with the happy madness of the sensitive people, with the aching soul of journeymen and the nostalgia for remote patriots, we howled and brayed like werewolves until morning.</seg>
<seg id="81">Each of your books is formally and in content different to the previous ones.</seg>
<seg id="82">Does that also apply to the text of Wind, Dark, Presence?</seg>
<seg id="83">It is a story.</seg>
<seg id="84">It is a fairy tale about one country beyond nine rivers and nine mountains.</seg>
<seg id="85">In his novel Dry Valley, Ivan Bunin puts the words of an old Russian fable in the mouth of a folk healer: On the sea, on the ocean, on the Bujan island.</seg>
<seg id="86">There lies a female dog, on her lies a grey casket.</seg>
<seg id="87">Horror, terror, mystery.</seg>
<seg id="88">It never happened, but we all know it from somewhere.</seg>
<seg id="89">Perhaps we were all once, long ago, devils in hell and drew lots for the role that we would play on this Earth.</seg>
<seg id="90">Do you plan to keep writing or are you going to wait again for a free influx of inspiration?</seg>
<seg id="91">Answers are eternal – Otokar Březina.</seg>
<seg id="92">Writing is a wondrous form of dialogue.</seg>
<seg id="93">Something huge and nameless, similar to the movement of continents on a planet, influences our desire from such a depth and in such breadth that it goes entirely beyond our horizon – and so as an absolute matter of course, we act precisely in line with our preprogrammed task.</seg>
<seg id="94">We are rewarded with an influx of dopamine, a mixture of endorphins and other substances.</seg>
<seg id="95">We are biological machines.</seg>
<seg id="96">We want to mate, we die in the defence of and conquering new personal territories.</seg>
<seg id="97">Sometimes there is a fault and we radiate compassion.</seg>
<seg id="98">Only then do we have the right to call ourselves human.</seg>
<seg id="99">That is the answer to your question – a biological robot is already full of various faults, it stands on the shores of the ocean of unconscious and catches inflows of balmy wind in torn sails made from a dirty handkerchief.</seg>
<seg id="100">I have to write to become a human.</seg>

<seg id="1">Obama's Health Care Walk Back</seg>
<seg id="2">Amid a firestorm of criticism, President Obama yesterday walked back his oft-repeated, unambiguous promise that "if you like your health plan, you can keep it."</seg>
<seg id="3">With hundreds of thousands receiving cancellation notices from their providers, Republicans have slammed the president in recent days for misleading the American public.</seg>
<seg id="4">Yesterday, Obama tweaked his original pledge.</seg>
<seg id="5">"For the vast majority of people who have health insurance that works, you can keep it," he said in a speech in Boston.</seg>
<seg id="6">Addressing what he called the "flurry in the news" about the cancellations, Obama urged Americans receiving these notices to shop for new coverage in the marketplace.</seg>
<seg id="7">Most people are going to be able to get better, comprehensive health care plans for the same price or even cheaper than projected.</seg>
<seg id="8">"You're going to get a better deal," he said.</seg>
<seg id="9">The administration has said it should come as no surprise that the 5 percent of the population who purchase insurance on their own may be forced to switch plans because their coverage doesn't meet the new standards required under the Affordable Care Act.</seg>
<seg id="10">"Let me say directly to these Americans: you deserve better," Sebelius said in testimony before the House Energy and Commerce Committee in Washington.</seg>
<seg id="11">Sebelius, who is overseeing implementation of the Affordable Care Act, said the launch of the online marketplace has gone "miserably" since October.</seg>
<seg id="12">"I am as frustrated and angry as anyone," she said.</seg>
<seg id="13">I am eager to earn your confidence back.</seg>
<seg id="14">An exasperated Sebelius uttered that phrase, caught by a hot mic, to an aide seated behind her at yesterday's House hearing following a contentious exchange with Rep. Billy Long, R-Mo., over whether she should be required to enroll in Obamacare.</seg>
<seg id="15">More than three hours into the hearing, Long repeatedly pressed Sebelius on why the "architect" of the Affordable Care Act has not voluntarily forgone government-sponsored insurance to purchase a plan through HealthCare.gov, which she is now pitching to millions of Americans.</seg>

<seg id="1">Which billionaire you will be talking to on the telephone next year?</seg>
<seg id="2">Kellner, the owner of PPF group, he wants to buy O2.</seg>
<seg id="3">Both firms confirmed the negotiations and, according to a variety of sources, from agencies and behind the scenes, it is reportedly already done and dusted.</seg>
<seg id="4">The announcement of the transaction should be made in November, probably before the auction of frequencies for LTE networks, therefore before 11 November.</seg>
<seg id="5">Kellner’s competitor Karel Komárek owns the KKCG group.</seg>
<seg id="6">This group started auctioning frequencies for LTE networks under the brand name Sazka Telecommunications.</seg>
<seg id="7">This was to everyone’s surprise, the company had not talked about its desire to get into telecommunications until this point.</seg>
<seg id="8">However, Sazka is now headed by the old hand Robert Chvátal, who is very experienced in telecommunications.</seg>
<seg id="9">He started as marketing director at Radiomobil (now T-Mobile), eventually becoming director of Slovakia’s T-Mobile and most recently he was the head of the Austrian branch of the same operator.</seg>
<seg id="10">Sazka is playing several cards at once.</seg>
<seg id="11">It joined the auction and has now admitted that it wants to launch a virtual network with Vodafone.</seg>
<seg id="12">And it makes sense.</seg>
<seg id="13">If successful in the auction, it will then be able to move existing customers from its own virtual operator to its own network.</seg>
<seg id="14">Under normal circumstances, Vodafone would probably not like that but, according to information from the newspaper Hospodářske Noviny, it may be a part of much closer cooperation of the two companies.</seg>
<seg id="15">Vodafone is currently suffering because of the agreement between competing operators O2 and T-Mobile, who will completely share their networks.</seg>
<seg id="16">Therefore Vodafone needs a partner.</seg>
<seg id="17">And this could be Sazka.</seg>
<seg id="18">If it is successful in the tender for LTE networks (as a newcomer it can auction a specially designated range), then Vodafone does not have to start the auction at all, or it will not mind auctioning just the specially designated range (there are not enough frequencies for all).</seg>
<seg id="19">Vodafone can actually share the network with Sazka.</seg>
<seg id="20">Vodafone will allow Sazka on its 2G/3G network (or the newly built LTE network with a frequency of 900 MHz) which allows the company to start the network quickly.</seg>
<seg id="21">Meanwhile Sazka will start building the costly LTE network which Vodafone will be also able to use.</seg>
<seg id="22">Both firms can be happy.</seg>
<seg id="23">Vodafone could then spend the money saved on a fixed internet or cable television provider.</seg>
<seg id="24">And Kellner?</seg>
<seg id="25">With the purchase of the Czech and Slovak O2 (the Slovak office is a subsidiary of the Czech company), he would get a fully fledged operator immediately with increasingly good profits and a wide range of services.</seg>
<seg id="26">But on the other hand, it is a huge juggernaut that will need restructuring.</seg>
<seg id="27">In auction, Kellner would get the LTE networks for O2 and very probably in collaboration with T-Mobile.</seg>
<seg id="28">Both companies have in fact declared that they will share the networks.</seg>
<seg id="29">The auction could therefore end successfully, but most probably not without the large sums that the state budget is looking forward to.</seg>
<seg id="30">And from the next year, Czech customers could therefore be choosing between calling with Vodafone, T-Mobile, Kellner or Komárek.</seg>
<seg id="31">Or two titans of Czech business against global giants.</seg>

<seg id="1">Can Czech Television ever make do without petitions?</seg>
<seg id="2">It stepped into the era of President Zeman with the legendary scene with the ash tray, so it is not hard to hear the complaints it collects with documents favouring the castle entourage.</seg>
<seg id="3">In the past, the impact of Ivan Langer or Jaroslav Tvrdík was not documented by anyone in such a way, let alone was it signed.</seg>
<seg id="4">The truth is, the editors stood up for the management.</seg>
<seg id="5">The cases described, however, do not answer the question of where such affection for Zeman’s people on the part of certain journalists comes from – whether it is a reaction to a direct commission or, without using vulgarism, a typical expression of misplaced, empathic helpfulness.</seg>
<seg id="6">And when we are already assuming general corruptness, we cannot resist the question as to whether other, equally unscrupulous power interests, who have not yet had the opportunity, are seeking to change the conditions in the television.</seg>
<seg id="7">Those who say that in developed countries blatant attempts by politicians to intervene in broadcasting do not happen are right.</seg>
<seg id="8">The truth, however, is also that it does not mean that complaints about public media do not exist there.</seg>
<seg id="9">Those complaining do not call into question their independence.</seg>
<seg id="10">In contrast, they mainly criticise what they consider a bias, which is intrinsic to them, which is the fruit of their subculture.</seg>
<seg id="11">Perhaps we just have not yet reached that civilised stage and this situation does not exist here.</seg>
<seg id="12">But perhaps also in a country which thinks itself the most corrupt in the world, black and white stories about evil politicians and good journalists pass more comfortably than more complicated descriptions of a chaotic situation, in which the behaviour of many imperfect human beings collide.</seg>

<seg id="1">JAN JANDOUREK: The curse of this country: presidents on the edge</seg>
<seg id="2">It is almost a rule that in key moments of the country, the head of state was not in the right condition to fulfil his duty as head of state.</seg>
<seg id="3">If Masaryk had been physically and mentally five years younger, he would have lived to the end of his presidential term and the events surrounding Munich would have taken place somewhat differently.</seg>
<seg id="4">We probably would not have won the war, but after symbolic resistance, the air force could have flown beyond the borders, heavy weapons could have been destroyed and the government could have fled to London immediately and would not have to fight there so hard for its legitimacy.</seg>
<seg id="5">And most importantly, the nation would not have a hangover from that surrender until now.</seg>
<seg id="6">Beneš was no statesman and after Munich he was still in a good shape, but during the war he started going downhill and in February 48 he acted accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="7">Had he been slightly better, he could have gone into exile for a third time and undermined the legitimacy of the Communists and their coup.</seg>
<seg id="8">And where to begin with Hácha?</seg>
<seg id="9">He was chosen with the proviso that "the President will not get into a situation where he would have to make a decision."</seg>
<seg id="10">But he had to, even though it probably wasn’t great decision making with a knife to his throat in Hitler’s Chancellery.</seg>
<seg id="11">In the last days of March 1939, intelligence chief František Moravec said everything that needed to be done so that the occupation, which he knew about exactly to the day, would not go so smoothly or with such gain.</seg>
<seg id="12">The senile president and cowardly government did nothing, as on the one hand they did not believe him and, on the other hand, they were afraid.</seg>
<seg id="13">The human wreck Gottwald had his old comrades executed as instructed by Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="14">Ludvík Svoboda was definitely discredited for his part in normalisation and, completely senile, he had to be deposed.</seg>
<seg id="15">That Husák being a helpless and sick, depressed old man only made the events in November 89 easier, but that is the only plus.</seg>
<seg id="16">Havel was lucky not to spend his last years in office – he was spared the worst.</seg>
<seg id="17">Klaus may still be a fresh tennis-playing pensioner, but many of his actions are suggesting that the though processes are not what they were.</seg>
<seg id="18">And now, here we have this.</seg>
<seg id="19">The head of state and commander in chief of the armed forces looks the way he does and we don’t even know everything yet.</seg>
<seg id="20">Luckily, now there is no external threat to the Republic.</seg>
<seg id="21">Or maybe there is, but it isn’t so visible.</seg>
<seg id="22">Then there is the issue whether it’s not good for a change (from a historical perspective) that the president is not really strong.</seg>
<seg id="23">But this is not a normal situation.</seg>
<seg id="24">Could we not elect a president once again in this country who is acceptably thoughtful and acceptably healthy?</seg>

<seg id="1">Distant planets, black and white films, or a little bit of fantasising about extraterrestrial life on earth are not topics that American jazz saxophonist Wayne Shorter should toss around carelessly.</seg>
<seg id="2">In the concept of his quartet, which will round off this year’s Strings of Autumn festival in the great hall at Prague’s Lucerna, everything actually is connected with everything.</seg>
<seg id="3">The momentary feelings of the musicians are the score for jazz saxophonist Wayne Shorter’s quartet.</seg>
<seg id="4">Under his instructions, his colleagues, who are two generations younger, should play what they are currently experiencing.</seg>
<seg id="5">They approach the music as an entirely improvised intimate affair and have to think not of the harmony or rhythm but in cinematic images.</seg>
<seg id="6">Of course, the recent octogenarian Shorter – an exceptional composer and winner of nine Grammys, who used to play with Miles Davis and is now probably the greatest jazz saxophonist alive – does not like to explain this principle.</seg>
<seg id="7">He doesn’t talk much about music, despite his outlook on life being so closely linked to it.</seg>

<seg id="1">How creepy-crawlies from Thailand have increased revenue at a Paris bar</seg>
<seg id="2">Maybe you pull faces over the insects without even realising that you eat about half a kilo of them a year quite voluntarily.</seg>
<seg id="3">For example, ground up in flour.</seg>
<seg id="4">If you consume them consciously, then you are definitely trendy: it’s green, nutritious and you have also got a unique experience covered.</seg>
<seg id="5">Elie Daviron, chef and owner of the bar Le Festin Nu, is the first in Paris to include insect on the menu at the beginning of October.</seg>
<seg id="6">The bar, whose name was inspired by the book Naked Lunch by William Burroughs, can be found in the fashionable 18th arrondissement not far from Montmartre, which is visited by tourists in great numbers.</seg>
<seg id="7">With fresh avocado, roasted red peppers, ginger and quail’s eggs, guests can now taste not only various larvae, grasshoppers or water beetles there, they can even try scorpions.</seg>
<seg id="8">Carefully and specially packaged deliveries (so as not to damage the insects’ wings, distort their legs or damage their eyes) are sent to Daviron from as far away as Thailand.</seg>
<seg id="9">Europe is just learning to eat insects, elsewhere it is common.</seg>
<seg id="10">The owner of the Paris bar with its pioneering menu promptly lists several reasons why to eat insects.</seg>
<seg id="11">The first is the environmental benefit, because production of insects is far less costly on our planet (in relation to finance, space and water consumption) than the traditional meat.</seg>
<seg id="12">"Furthermore, insects are an excellent source of protein and omega 3 fatty acids," Daviron told Reuters.</seg>
<seg id="13">At the same time, the young chef does not deny his profession, he just aims to offer his customers a unique culinary experience.</seg>
<seg id="14">In his opinion, enjoyment, a sense of sin and the atmosphere of the environment make a proper restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="15">"I’m not saving the world, I'm just providing a new experience," he explained.</seg>
<seg id="16">It is not everyone by far who would be enthusiastic about the idea of eating a beetle garnished with pesto, but the reaction of customers at this Parisian bar to the insects served has been very positive, according to the owner.</seg>
<seg id="17">Even sceptics have allegedly tried them, although they start with the smallest mouthful and only in the end do they choose a scorpion.</seg>
<seg id="18">Prices for these tasting plates range from five to nine euros.</seg>

<seg id="2">The Czech construction industry has been struggling with a continuing fall in the number of orders and a lack of state interest to address the problem of capital construction since 2008.</seg>
<seg id="3">The announcement of the New Green for Savings programme was a positive sign for our construction industry, especially for small and medium-sized companies in the individual regions.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is a great opportunity, not just for citizens to save a significant amount on heating after implementing measures, but also a chance for construction companies and building material manufacturers.</seg>

<seg id="1">John Kerry says US spying has "reached too far inappropriately" in unprecedented admission</seg>
<seg id="2">John Kerry has indicated a softening of the U.S's defensive stance on its surveillance programmes with an unprecedented admission that on occasions its spying has "reached too far inappropriately."</seg>
<seg id="3">The Secretary of State also admitted that he'd been guilty, along with Barack Obama, of being on "automatic pilot" as incendiary revelations from whistleblower Edward Snowden about the NSA's spying activities emerged.</seg>
<seg id="4">The leaks have put the US government at the centre of a diplomatic storm with its allies.</seg>
<seg id="5">Speaking to an open government conference in London via video link, Mr Kerry said: "There is no question that the President and I and others in government have actually learned of some things that had been happening on an automatic pilot because the ability has been there, going back to World War Two and to the very difficult years of the Cold War, and then, of course, 9/11."</seg>
<seg id="6">He then became the first high-ranking member of the U.S government to admit that US spying had crossed the line, but emphasised that no one's rights had been abused.</seg>
<seg id="7">He said: "In some cases, it has reached too far inappropriately."</seg>
<seg id="8">And the President is determined to try to clarify and make clear for people and is now doing a thorough review in order that nobody will have the sense of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="9">I assure you innocent people are not being abused in this process.</seg>
<seg id="10">Mr Kerry insisted, however, that the NSA was a force for good and that its surveillance operations had saved many lives.</seg>
<seg id="11">He added: "We're dealing in a new world where people are willing to blow themselves up."</seg>
<seg id="12">There is radical extremism in the world that is hell-bent and determined to try to kill people and blow people up and attack governments.</seg>
<seg id="13">So what if you were able to intercept that and stop it before it happens?</seg>
<seg id="14">We have actually prevented airplanes from going down, buildings from being blown up, and people from being assassinated because we've been able to learn ahead of time of the plans.</seg>
<seg id="15">Meanwhile, U.S. lawmakers will head to Europe to help address concerns abroad about alleged U.S. spying and convince the Europeans of the need to continue joint anti-terrorism efforts with the U.S., the chairman of a Senate subcommittee on European affairs said on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="16">Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut said he spoke with European Parliament members and others this week and is concerned about their threats to stop participating in anti-terrorist organizations because of frustration over surveillance by the National Security Agency.</seg>
<seg id="17">"It's really important for U.S. national security interests for Europeans to stay on board with us with respect to our mutual anti-terrorism endeavors," Murphy, a first-term Democrat and chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Subcommittee on European Affairs, said in an interview from Washington.</seg>
<seg id="18">And I'm going to Europe to make it clear to them that we need to continue to work together in combatting terrorism, notwithstanding their anger over these NSA programs.</seg>
<seg id="19">News reports that the NSA swept up millions of phone records in Europe have frayed relations with some U.S. allies, though the agency's chief said this week that they were inaccurate and reflected a misunderstanding of metadata that Nato allies collected and shared with the United States.</seg>
<seg id="20">Other revelations cited documents leaked by Snowden that the NSA monitored German Chancellor Angela Merkel's cellphone and those of up to 34 other world leaders.</seg>
<seg id="21">The national intelligence director, James Clapper, defended spying on allies as necessary and said it's commonplace on both sides.</seg>
<seg id="22">Amid the uproar, Murphy said his office is arranging the congressional trip, expected to take place this year, and hopes the delegation will include members of both parties and both chambers.</seg>
<seg id="23">Names of other participating lawmakers were to be released in coming days.</seg>
<seg id="24">He said the itinerary is still being worked out.</seg>
<seg id="25">While Murphy said the purpose of the trip is to help improve relationships, he said some "tough love" will also be dispensed.</seg>
<seg id="26">He said European leaders need to be honest with their own people about the kind of espionage programs they've used for years themselves.</seg>
<seg id="27">"While we can amend our surveillance programs to better protect the rights of Europeans, they also need to come to terms with the fact that we're not the only ones that are out there spying," Murphy said.</seg>
<seg id="28">Meanwhile, Mr Kerry is scheduled to head this weekend to the Middle East and Poland to address rancor over U.S. strategies in the Syria, Egypt and Iran as well as U.S. surveillance activities.</seg>

<seg id="2">A 21-year-old Sydney woman sentenced to 15 days jail in Phuket for falsely claiming she was assaulted by a taxi driver is appealing the verdict and has been granted bail.</seg>
<seg id="3">Stevie Rochelle Bamford was initially found guilty by a Phuket provincial court on June 15 of making false claims after telling Thai police a local taxi driver, with two other men restraining her, carried out the assault in the early hours of Sunday June 10.</seg>
<seg id="4">However, CCTV footage later revealed she had returned to her hotel safely after becoming separated from her Australian boyfriend.</seg>
<seg id="5">Phuket police interviewed Bamford for two days before she confessed to fabricating the story.</seg>
<seg id="6">She was held in local police cells before the court hearing.</seg>
<seg id="7">Bamford was sentenced to serve the 15-day prison term at a low security detention centre on the outskirts of Phuket rather than in an adult women's jail.</seg>
<seg id="8">She is the daughter of former Australian league player Peter Tunks, who has appealed to the Department of Foreign Affairs in Canberra to assist his daughter.</seg>
<seg id="9">Tunks told Sydney's Sunday Telegraph the whole family was "extremely concerned" about his daughter's welfare and wanted her back in Australia.</seg>
<seg id="10">"It's obviously been a worrying time but we're hopeful to have her back home safely as soon as possible," Tunks said.</seg>
<seg id="11">Bamford is appealing the sentence and has been granted bail of 50,000 baht.</seg>
<seg id="12">Reports in Australia said that in the meantime, she was holidaying at the resort area of Krabi in Southern Thailand.</seg>
<seg id="13">Thai-based legal sources said Bamford was being represented by a local lawyer in Phuket but warned that the appeal may lead to the court increasing her sentence by up to two years and forcing her to serve it in an adult prison.</seg>
<seg id="14">However, following the recent murder of Australian travel agent Michelle Smith in Phuket, Thailand may also be looking to repair its battered tourist image, leading to an acquittal.</seg>

<seg id="1">Post-election goulash rather than post-election tenderloin</seg>
<seg id="2">The October election brought a bunch of losers rather than a winner.</seg>
<seg id="3">It is not just the parties who did not even get to the Chamber of Deputies (e. g. SPOZ), but also the previous government parties (ODS, TOP 09) and finally even the ČSSD due to its internal rift.</seg>
<seg id="4">Over the weekend, politicians served us a post-election goulash rather than a festive tenderloin.</seg>
<seg id="5">The biggest jump in the election was from Andrej Babiš’s movement, who promised voters they would change the political style of governing.</seg>
<seg id="6">The fragmentation of the election results and the rift in the winning party plays up to the political will/despotism of President Miloš Zeman regardless of the wishes of voters, who did not even elect the party publicly supported by President Zeman to the Chamber of Deputies.</seg>
<seg id="7">While the president lost his strategic edge over other politicians due to the unpleasant events, he still has several ways of getting it back – for example by selecting the future prime minister.</seg>
<seg id="8">While the ČSSD's chances of getting the premiership, in my view, are disappearing, the businessman Andrej Babiš is getting closer.</seg>
<seg id="9">Post-election development may still be far removed from the early and smooth creation of a stable government, but in comparison with the pre-election scenario of the left-wing government of the ČSSD supported by the Communists, this development is still better news for business in the Czech Republic and therefore the economy.</seg>
<seg id="10">Due to the vocal opposition of ANO to get together with ODS or TOP 09, the most likely option is still a coalition between ČSSD, ANO and KDU-ČSL (a total of 111 MPs).</seg>
<seg id="11">Due to the rift within ČSSD, which consequently became an unreadable and weak partner in negotiations, the result of coalition talks may be quite depressing for the ČSSD.</seg>
<seg id="12">A minority government of the ČSSD made up of anti-Zeman people will probably not pass through at the Castle.</seg>
<seg id="13">In addition, any government in which the ČSSD participates will be threatened by the unsatisfied ambitions of many Social Democrats, which may sooner or later lead to another rift within the party.</seg>
<seg id="14">So I ask myself: "Are we not going headlong into another early election?"</seg>
<seg id="15">Another election would be more of a referendum on the power of an electoral mandate for the ANO movement.</seg>
<seg id="16">Plans of the ČSSD to introduce sector taxes, a more significant increase in income tax and building of the state bank have hopefully fallen under the table.</seg>
<seg id="17">The ČSSD, ANO, KDU-ČSL and Úsvit (Dawn) parties, in contrast, agree for example on promoting business, a moderate fiscal policy (a government deficit below 3% GDP), supporting employment for the disadvantaged, and reducing the lower rate of VAT for selected goods.</seg>
<seg id="18">Friction surfaces are most often found in the view of social policy and the size of the state.</seg>
<seg id="19">ANO now has the upper hand, however, so for now the programme of the most probable coalition of ANO, ČSSD and KDU-ČSL would lean more to the right.</seg>
<seg id="20">From my point of view, this is in the end a better result than a left-wing programme with tax on everything that still moves in the economy.</seg>
